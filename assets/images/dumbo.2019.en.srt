1
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:51,300
Come on, time to go.
We haven't got all day.

2
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,890
Get that monkey on the train.

3
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,940
The Medici Brothers' circus is taking off!

4
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,020
Breathing normal...

5
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,230
heart rate normal.

6
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,690
You're cleared to perform.

7
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,360
Milly!
Another train!

8
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,280
<i>Niños,</i> wait!
We are coming, too!

9
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,880
Joplin!

10
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,510
Joplin, Missouri!

11
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,470
-Hey, sweetheart!
-Daddy!

12
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:09,250
Oh, I meant to tell ya.

13
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,920
You know, in the letter I sent?

14
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:15,430
I'm so sorry that I wasn't here.

15
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,840
Well, come here now.

16
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,180
Still me.

17
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,900
And you...

18
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,230
you're just as pretty as your momma.

19
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,200
We missed you, Dad.

20
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,080
I missed you, too.

21
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,290
Ivan and Catherine, thank you both...

22
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,000
for looking out for them.

23
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,590
Captain Farrier, of course.

24
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,380
It's Holt, come on now.

25
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:57,800
It's just Holt.

26
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,470
Don't you worry.

27
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,310
Everything's gonna be
just like it was before.

28
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,480
Come on! Come on!

29
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:09,940
Home sweet home.

30
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,230
-Hey! Holt!
-Hey, Puck.

31
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,530
-Hey, Thomas.
-Milly, come on!

32
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:15,860
Hi, Holt.

33
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,030
Hey, Miss Atlantis.

34
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,370
Pramesh!

35
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,160
The very best journey, dear friend.

36
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,580
The road that leads home.

37
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,830
Welcome home.

38
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,250
No hugs!

39
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:36,170
Pramesh, I missed you, too.

40
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:39,380
What's going on?
The camp's half the size it used to be.

41
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:42,010
Hard times, my friend.
For everyone.

42
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,270
Attention, everybody!

43
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:54,650
Why is Rule Number One
called Rule Number One?

44
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:59,610
Because "keep the cages locked"
is the most important rule of all!

45
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:03,280
When I catch that fugitive scalawag
who interrupted my dream...

46
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:04,330
Rongo!

47
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,740
Where is Rongo?

48
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,790
Who's heading camp management?

49
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,960
I'm the strongman.

50
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,670
Yes, but we're all wearing multiple hats!

51
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,420
You're in charge of budgets,
and accounting, and inventory.

52
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:20,050
Which means animal whereabouts!

53
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,090
Now, go find that monkey!

54
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,140
I'll have a look around.

55
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,600
All right, everybody. Back to work.

56
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,030
Holt!

57
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,660
This winter, the influenza
hit us like a hurricane.

58
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:55,080
Natalya, Vincenzo...

59
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,800
the Vanderjees, and then...

60
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:01,170
your wife.

61
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,970
Poor Annie.

62
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,260
How she fought.

63
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,020
She was the best of us.

64
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,900
I know it.

65
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,110
So, you know, for her,
let's have our best season yet!

66
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:22,030
Now where's my horses?

67
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,910
Funny story about that.

68
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,330
Funny how?

69
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:28,450
He sold them.

70
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,290
But our act is the soul of this show!

71
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:35,830
And first, we lost you,
and then Annie, to ride 'em!

72
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,170
If only Milly would have learned the trade.

73
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,840
I don't wanna be a show-off in your circus.

74
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,010
-"Show-off"?
-You see?

75
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,510
I wanna make scientific discoveries.

76
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,340
I wanna be noticed for my mind.

77
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,510
Okay.

78
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,470
Then learn clairvoyance. Telepathy!
Something!

79
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,520
I can do a handstand for almost ten seconds.

80
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:00,570
"Child does handstand."
We'll be broke by July.

81
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,860
Hang on now.
Without horses, what the hell's my act?

82
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,780
The crowds come to see me!

83
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,280
Max, please.

84
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,620
I need to work.

85
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,500
Good news.

86
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,290
One job, I have.

87
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,420
Okay, then. Give me a showstopper.

88
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:21,750
You know that old rascal Itchy McPhee?
He finally ran off with the bearded lady.

89
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,050
I've been filling in with
roustabouts ever since.

90
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,050
I need somebody good to tend the elephants.

91
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,100
No, you're not serious.

92
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,390
I am on occasion.

93
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,020
This is a big job and you know it.

94
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,600
No, it's a big shovel for a big pile of...

95
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:35,770
Dad.

96
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,360
So you sold my horses
and kept your elephants.

97
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,690
Your scrawny, mangy, cut-rate elephants.

98
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,240
They're important.
Especially this season.

99
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,740
Why's that?

100
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,870
I know it goes against my nature...

101
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,660
but for once, I made an investment.

102
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,880
There she is!

103
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,590
Our brand-new Asian female.

104
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:07,680
I bought her off a Brugelbecker in Biloxi.
I had to get him way down on the price.

105
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:12,390
But I swear to you, Holt,
I saw something special in her eyes.

106
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,480
This is your investment?
An old, sick elephant.

107
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,190
Oh, no. She's not sick.

108
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,610
Any day now...

109
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,940
She's having a baby.

110
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:30,070
Dad, watch! Dad! I'm getting better!

111
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,780
Hang on now, this is our tent?

112
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,490
What happened to our things?

113
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,710
We had nice furniture, we had rooms.

114
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,040
Max, what didn't you sell?

115
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,540
You son of a gun.

116
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,130
Dad, look!

117
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,920
Toys?

118
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:49,300
They're not toys.
They're for my science experiments.

119
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,970
Well, we're a circus, darlin', a circus.

120
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,640
We need to be practical
if we want to survive.

121
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:57,270
You couldn't just take up one act?

122
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,640
Tumblin' or tightrope?

123
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:01,650
Maybe I don't need the world staring at me.

124
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,570
Maybe I'm just not you and Mom.

125
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,030
Well, who makes the rules in this family?

126
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,490
Mom did.

127
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,280
Yeah, well, I make them now.

128
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,200
So just... Go to your room!

129
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,620
This is my room.

130
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,660
This is all our rooms.

131
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,830
See this?

132
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:19,910
You know what this is?

133
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,580
It's your inheritance.

134
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,880
Dad!

135
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,550
Don't worry, he's not going anywhere.

136
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,380
He's stuck here.

137
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,300
Like you and me.

138
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,570
Come on, come on,
you're missing it!

139
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,950
Look, I can do it!
I'm doing it, Milly!

140
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,870
A new season!

141
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:10,260
Let me in, you little hairball!

142
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,140
Hey!

143
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,020
Would somebody please let me in my own train?

144
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:08,150
Dad, wake up! Let's go!

145
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,480
The elephants need us!

146
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:12,400
Good God, son,
you're gonna make me miss the war.

147
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:15,910
Gimme that. Go on, lead the way.

148
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,870
Move it!

149
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,910
Let's skedaddle, Mrs. Jumbo!
Don't make me have to incentivize.

150
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,870
Get her out of there, boys.

151
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,630
Easy, Rufus.

152
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,960
That's a lady in there.

153
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:32,920
Well, well, our own Tom Mix
ridin' in to the rescue.

154
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:35,220
But he just ain't on the marquee no more.

155
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,970
Time to see what he's been missing.

156
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,590
Do you ever get that feeling?

157
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,050
Like there's something you're missing?

158
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,350
Imagine my surprise, you didn't enlist.

159
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,430
Weak ticker. Doc's advice.

160
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,900
Dad? Something's wrong.

161
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,690
She doesn't wanna leave.

162
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,240
Come on!

163
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,900
Let's get her outta there!

164
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,780
What are you doing?

165
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:01,660
Come on!

166
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,120
Leave her alone!

167
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:05,960
-Stop hurting her, please!
-Leave her alone!

168
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:18,970
Dad, look.

169
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,510
What now?

170
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,760
Move her!

171
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,350
Whoa, we got a baby in here.

172
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:35,490
She had a baby!

173
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:37,820
Baby!
Notify the press!

174
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:38,990
"The Medici Brothers...

175
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,410
"proudly present America's newest,
precious bundle of joy!"

176
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:46,540
Look at that.

177
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,000
It's okay now.

178
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,290
Don't be scared.

179
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:58,380
Don't be scared now,
your momma's right outside.

180
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,290
Baby! We got a baby!

181
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,920
We got a baby!

182
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,630
What is that?

183
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,840
Baby Jumbo.

184
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:45,010
I already got fake freaks in the freak show!

185
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,310
I don't need a real one in the center ring!

186
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,980
Rongo!
We've been swindled!

187
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,560
Gone and bought yourself a baby monster.

188
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:54,520
Think he can hear me?

189
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,440
Boo!

190
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:18,000
Rongo! Telegram to Brugelbecker.

191
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:19,920
"We have been bilked with damaged goods.

192
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:23,430
"This is an aberration, travestation...

193
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,090
"and I demand my money back."

194
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,890
But whatever you do, do not call the papers.

195
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,430
We are not advertising this baby.

196
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,270
Tell me you didn't do it.

197
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,440
You did it?

198
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:40,280
Never do anything I tell ya
without checking with me first!

199
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,030
Why me? Why me?

200
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,700
A face only a mother could love.

201
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:50,790
Sir?

202
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,250
Many of us find you handsome.

203
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,290
I was talking about the elephant!

204
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:02,670
Look, she's drawing him a bath.

205
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:10,100
Need a vet to come to look at him, Max.

206
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,850
No, no witnesses!

207
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:15,600
We are going to be in Joplin for two weeks.
We promised them a beautiful baby!

208
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:17,940
You have until tomorrow night to fix that!

209
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,520
-Me?
-Yes, you!

210
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:20,820
This is my problem?

211
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,110
Yes.
You tend the elephants.

212
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,150
Make those ears disappear!

213
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,910
Don't look at me.

214
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,590
Look at him,
those giant ears weigh him down.

215
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,550
Hi, Baby Jumbo.

216
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,310
Welcome to the circus.

217
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:54,430
We're all family here.
No matter how small.

218
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,770
Aren't elephants afraid of mice?

219
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,440
Says who?
That's why we experiment.

220
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,820
Someone needs to keep him company
when he's not with his momma.

221
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,210
Look. Give him one.

222
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,920
If he can lift his ears out of the way.

223
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,630
No. You have to blow your ears
out of the way.

224
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,130
Like this.

225
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,510
Good luck with that.
Maybe you can teach him to juggle, too.

226
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,680
Baby Jumbo, look at me.

227
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:35,850
Do what I do.

228
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,310
Blow.

229
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,950
No, not the feather.
Your ears. Blow!

230
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,110
He thinks it's a game.

231
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:52,830
-Max, come here.
-What?

232
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,040
Watch this.

233
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,210
I ride out, I do some jumps,
then all of a sudden...

234
00:17:58,790 --> 00:17:59,790
stampede!

235
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,250
Send 'em!

236
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,340
Get out of the way, Max!

237
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,800
I'm still working out the timing.

238
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,310
Let me have a turn.

239
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:34,410
Meanwhile,
for when you lead out the elephants...

240
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,740
I had the costume departments
make you up a little something.

241
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:37,830
Okay.

242
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,790
What in gosh...

243
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,630
You really broke the bank with this, Max.

244
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,170
A lot of kids come to the show.

245
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,920
You don't want me to scare anyone,
I get it.

246
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:47,010
Dad, Dad!

247
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:48,630
It's Baby Jumbo. Come see.

248
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,550
He jumped in the air. With his ears.

249
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,140
Guys, I said leave him be.

250
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,340
But he was this far off the ground!

251
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,510
Yeah, I bet he was.

252
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,260
He'll be tripping all over
with ears like that.

253
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,390
Dad, really. We tried an experiment.

254
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,270
Just leave the poor guy alone.

255
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:07,400
First rule of science,
you have to have interest.

256
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:09,940
Otherwise, you don't deserve to know.

257
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:14,070
It's been a rough year for both of them.

258
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,830
Annie knew how to talk to 'em.

259
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,040
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
step right up.</i>

260
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:28,420
<i>Hurry, hurry. Come see the circus today.</i>

261
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:37,010
"To be or not to be...

262
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,810
"that is the question.

263
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:43,730
"Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
the slings and arrows of outrageous..."

264
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:02,910
That ain't no snake.

265
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,210
Heck, I could do it.

266
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,210
As you wish.

267
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,000
Get out of here!

268
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,960
Rongo, let's go!

269
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:17,100
Hey, get away from the baby elephant!

270
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,790
Welcome, Joplin, Missouri!

271
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,870
Ladies and gentlemen...

272
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:50,130
I am your Master of Ceremonies,
Maximilian Medici.

273
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:54,380
And now, I give to you...

274
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:56,970
the Medici Brothers' circus.

275
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,390
Okay.

276
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,270
Okay, okay, no one's gonna hurt him.

277
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,360
Okay, little guy, let's put on a show.

278
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,720
Hey, ain't that Holt Farrier,
the Stallion Star?

279
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:42,310
Hey!

280
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:43,720
Ain't you Holt Farrier?

281
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,350
Nah, he died in the war.
So sad.

282
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,740
What's he doing?

283
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,250
He's reaching for the feathers.

284
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,680
Coat, coat, coat, coat!

285
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:43,200
What'd you do to that thing?
That ain't a real elephant.

286
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:44,910
Those ears are fake!

287
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,660
Look! Look at the sign!

288
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:47,910
"Dumbo!"

289
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,050
Calm down, now.

290
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,680
He's a fake!

291
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,140
Yeah, he's a fake!

292
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:07,310
Shut up!

293
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,020
You're scaring the elephants!

294
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,650
Take it easy now. Calm down.

295
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:14,650
Dumbo, Dumbo, fake, fake, fake!

296
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:17,570
All right, sit down.

297
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,940
-Dumbo, Dumbo, fake, fake, fake!
-I said sit down!

298
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:22,160
It's okay, little fella.

299
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,950
Fake!

300
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,410
Rongo! Music!

301
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,660
Happiness, joy!

302
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,050
Hear 'em making fun of your ugly baby?

303
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,640
Who's gonna help him now?

304
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:49,270
Holt, get those ears off the stage!

305
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:59,900
Okay, all right.

306
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,280
Okay, nobody's gonna hurt your baby.

307
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,950
Just calm down.

308
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,370
Okay. Attagirl.

309
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:08,280
We're here to protect him. Same as you.

310
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,000
Attagirl.

311
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,790
Nice and easy.

312
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,880
Okay, nobody's gonna hurt your baby.

313
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,510
Rufus, no!

314
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,890
-Rufus, stop!
-Mad elephant!

315
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:27,100
Get back!

316
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:35,020
Max, get the kids out of here!

317
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:36,980
Everybody, out!
Get to safety.

318
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,520
Careful, careful.

319
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,950
Kids?

320
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,240
Go, go, go!

321
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:49,410
Quick, quick, quick.
Go, go, go.

322
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,620
Come on, this way.

323
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:55,080
How do you like your job now, cowboy?

324
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:04,470
Milly, Joe!
Come on!

325
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,720
Let's go!
Come on!

326
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,090
And I wanna just emphasize,
we did everything right.

327
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:47,510
What it is, the tent just absolutely
fell down. It just collapsed.

328
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,890
And we had no way of knowing
what was gonna happen.

329
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,520
Brugelbecker, I have a man dead,
do you understand?

330
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,850
This is what they're reading
from the Great Lakes to the Gulf!

331
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:07,360
You have a moral responsibility
to buy your killer elephant back.

332
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,400
What about the baby?

333
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:13,280
Well, at least he got a few laughs.

334
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:17,120
I'll put him in the clown act,
see if I can salvage something.

335
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:20,910
I'll buy her back half price.

336
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,960
You will buy her back full price.

337
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,380
Quarter price.

338
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,800
Half price it is!

339
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,590
Up!

340
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,640
What's happening?
Where are they taking her?

341
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:41,980
Away. Back to your tent now.

342
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,600
But she's his mom!

343
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:45,560
Dad, please. Stop them.

344
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:46,900
Please!

345
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,520
Do something.

346
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:50,230
Mom would have done something.

347
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,610
Momma's not here.

348
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,780
Okay, little fella. Okay. Come on.

349
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,460
I know, I do.

350
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,880
Beautiful creature,
we'll take care of your son.

351
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,250
Darlin', it's late.

352
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,090
Go on now.

353
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:31,940
I know. I can't sleep, either.

354
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:37,730
My momma told me there'd be times
when my life seemed locked behind a door.

355
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:44,620
So, she gave me this key,
that her momma gave her.

356
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:51,210
And said whenever I have that feeling,
imagine that door...

357
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,750
and just turn the key.

358
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:57,550
So, I keep trying.

359
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:07,260
Not supposed to be in here alone.

360
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,680
I'm not. You're here.

361
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:11,020
What's that?

362
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,310
I just thought he might be hungry.

363
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:15,310
He's sad.

364
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,770
You don't eat when you're sad.

365
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,400
The mermaid does.

366
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,570
Come on.

367
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,990
Have one, Dumbo.

368
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:26,820
We're calling him Dumbo now?

369
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:29,620
If we call him Jumbo Junior...

370
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:32,160
it might make him miss his mom.

371
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:40,590
Here you go... Dumbo.

372
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:44,220
Come on, and flap those ears again.

373
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,590
To show us we didn't imagine it.

374
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:54,140
Your momma,
she didn't mean to hurt anyone.

375
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,150
She was just protecting you.

376
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:59,900
And we think your ears are great.

377
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:06,780
Maybe he wants to be alone.
Like Dad.

378
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,660
Nobody wants to be alone.

379
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:11,580
Well...

380
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:15,080
if you change your mind...

381
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:19,630
Night-night, Dumbo.

382
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:50,580
Wow!

383
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:56,620
It's not the peanuts that made him do it.

384
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:58,040
It's the feathers!

385
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,970
Dumbo!

386
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,620
Dumbo, you gotta do this in the show.

387
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:39,790
What do you mean?

388
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:43,000
'Cause if the circus sells more tickets
and Medici makes more money...

389
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:45,300
then we can get him to use some
to buy Mrs. Jumbo back.

390
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,510
Yeah!

391
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,970
We can get her back, Dumbo.
You can.

392
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,760
Just show them all what you can do.

393
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:52,260
Come on. We gotta tell Dad.

394
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:55,100
No. He'll just tell us to be practical.

395
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,060
Shows got canceled for a week, right?

396
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,310
We can research and study and test.

397
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:03,860
You're a miracle elephant, Dumbo.

398
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:06,230
And we're gonna bring your momma home.

399
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,950
Fire!

400
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,340
So low.

401
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,260
An all-time low.

402
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:37,180
Who said he didn't want to be recognized?

403
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:42,350
Okay, Big D, this is it.
Just like in rehearsal.

404
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,360
Except for lights, music, fire and crowds.

405
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,320
You can do it.

406
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,480
Come on, Dumbo.

407
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,320
You can do it, Dumbo!

408
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:50,740
Show 'em all like you showed us!

409
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:57,240
-Come! Come! Come!
-Attaboy, come on.

410
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,870
Keep comin'. Come on.

411
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:07,800
Go on now, Dumbo!
Come on.

412
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,430
Hey! Hey!

413
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,000
They love it! They love it!

414
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:46,330
All right, Dumbo.

415
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,790
You put out the fire.

416
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,400
He won't fly. He's scared.

417
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,270
I know.
Now, he's up too high.

418
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:17,530
Go on, Dumbo!

419
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,840
Attaboy.

420
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:38,430
Yeah! Rule Number One.

421
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,260
"Always have a big finish!"

422
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:51,480
Okay, guys.
Bring him down.

423
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:53,780
Yeah!

424
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:06,080
Holt!

425
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:08,290
-Look, Max!
-What? What?

426
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,210
-He's trapped up there.
-Put the fire out!

427
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:13,880
Dumbo! Fly!

428
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:15,840
He won't fly without a feather!

429
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,350
Put the fire out!

430
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,600
Put it out!

431
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:26,230
-Joe!
-Stop!

432
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:30,770
Holt, I thought she didn't want to be
in an act.

433
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:34,900
Milly!

434
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:52,880
Here, Dumbo!

435
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:55,050
Come on.

436
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:56,710
Show 'em.

437
00:38:58,470 --> 00:38:59,720
Come on, Dumbo.

438
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:27,870
Fly, Dumbo.

439
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:28,960
Fly!

440
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:47,060
Yeah!

441
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:24,090
You knew he could do this?

442
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,140
You should talk to your kids more.

443
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:38,110
Sotheby...

444
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:39,690
cancel my dinner with the president.

445
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,700
We've got business with an elephant.

446
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:50,660
Friends, the next available shows
are in Arkansas!

447
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,160
<i>Happy clowns!</i>

448
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:00,550
-Rongo the Strong!
-Boss.

449
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:02,470
Hello, Jo!

450
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:04,930
The Medici Brothers' circus.

451
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:09,060
Where true love and mystery abound!

452
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:12,640
Now where's my star?

453
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:15,060
Dumbo!

454
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:16,270
How's your bath?

455
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,310
Too warm? Too cold?

456
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,570
Ladies, make sure his wrinkles
don't get wrinkles.

457
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:26,320
In our country, legend tells us
the gods can take animal forms.

458
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:28,490
Champagne for Dumbo!

459
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,160
No booze near the baby!

460
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:53,980
Sorry, Dumbo.

461
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:56,390
It's not your momma.

462
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,230
Take Dumbo back inside.

463
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:11,740
Ladies and gentlemen, please make way
for the emperor of enchantment.

464
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:13,240
For the architect of dreams.

465
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:15,330
For the Columbus of Coney Island.

466
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,870
Mr. V.A. Vandevere!

467
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:24,840
And traveling with him,
his bright shining star.

468
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:28,300
Colette Marchant,
the Queen of the Heavens!

469
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:30,090
Miss Marchant! Miss Marchant!

470
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,100
<i>Signore</i> Medici!

471
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:39,310
He knows who I am.

472
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,020
We were just passing through Missouri...

473
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:43,110
and we heard you were putting on
a little show.

474
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:46,280
Mr. Vandevere. It's an honor.

475
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:49,820
No, sir. The honor is mine.

476
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:53,790
I would like to offer you a drink.

477
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:56,620
But I'm all out of bourbon.

478
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:00,420
And cognac and scotch.

479
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:07,880
Not now!

480
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:12,300
Is that a monkey in your desk?

481
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:14,430
Just for emergencies.

482
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,850
Look, Mr. Vandevere...

483
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:18,560
I probably should tell you...

484
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:21,020
the elephant is not for sale.

485
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:23,690
Dumbo will only fly for the Medici circus.

486
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:26,230
That's assuming he is real.

487
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,530
See for yourself.

488
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:37,080
And all due respect, I don't got all day.

489
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:38,660
-Pleasure to meet you...
-Excuse me.

490
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:40,920
Hello there.

491
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:51,050
So this creature of yours...

492
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:52,840
is supposed to fly?

493
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:55,760
Trade secrets.

494
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:08,480
Max, if you don't mind my asking...

495
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:12,950
where did you come upon the animal?

496
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:15,280
He hails from the far east.

497
00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:16,450
How far?

498
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,080
Far.

499
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,790
He doesn't look like "magic" to me.

500
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:23,670
Well, what the heck can you tell
by appearances, right?

501
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,540
And you train flying elephants, too?

502
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:28,800
Yeah, it's a little hobby on the side.

503
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:33,220
It's the kids taught Dumbo.

504
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:37,720
Ah, yes.

505
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:42,390
Yeah?

506
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,100
And how on earth did you do that?

507
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:47,440
With the scientific method.

508
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,530
One picture, one picture!

509
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:52,650
Max.

510
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:56,160
You possess something
that's very rare in life.

511
00:44:56,320 --> 00:45:00,790
And the tragedy of it is,
is you don't even know that you have it.

512
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:04,420
Do you know what it is that you have, Max?

513
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:05,500
No.

514
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:07,250
It's mystique.

515
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:10,800
Max, I know your type.

516
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,340
Charlatan, con man, opportunist...

517
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:16,340
New York is that way,
in case you need directions.

518
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:20,720
And I know it comes from a deep desire
to build something authentic and true.

519
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:22,520
I know your game.

520
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:23,850
It's not a game.

521
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:27,480
Some men cheat the rules,
others change them.

522
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:29,940
It's up your sleeve.

523
00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:32,990
It's in your pocket.

524
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:43,370
The secret to show business
is always keep a rabbit in your hat.

525
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:46,040
Or a monkey in your desk, I guess.

526
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:49,090
Ownership shares?

527
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:52,710
Max, look around you.
Your entire way of life is dying.

528
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,220
The future of the entertainment business
is to bring the audience to you.

529
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:58,050
And I've built that destination.

530
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:00,600
What I'm lacking...

531
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,350
is a protégé.

532
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:09,150
I know there's no Medici Brothers.

533
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:13,230
You probably always wanted one.

534
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:15,820
You're offering me a partnership?

535
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:16,990
Yes.

536
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,910
And a home.

537
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:20,660
For you and the entire troupe.

538
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:23,950
A home?
For all of us?

539
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:26,460
Yes. Join me.

540
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:28,500
Join me and my family.

541
00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:31,210
Let me take us all into the future.

542
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:34,380
Let me take us all...

543
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:36,300
to Dreamland!

544
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:20,890
I wish Momma could've seen this.

545
00:47:21,970 --> 00:47:24,350
Well, somehow,
I think she knows we're here.

546
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:32,020
Way to work your magic, Max.

547
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:44,080
We hear you, Dumbo!

548
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:46,790
Why won't you let him see outside?

549
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:48,910
Remember, young lady...

550
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,370
mystique.

551
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:57,210
Now this is why I joined the circus.

552
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:02,550
Dad.
Wonders of Science!

553
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:05,430
All right, sugar plum.
Remember, we got a job to do here.

554
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:08,310
My daughter, she fancies herself
the next Marie Curie.

555
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:12,520
Don't ever let anybody tell you
what you can't do.

556
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:15,230
Hang on, I wasn't saying she can't.

557
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:19,320
What is it exactly that we do here,
<i>ma chérie?</i>

558
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:22,570
We make the impossible possible.

559
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:30,040
And that's where you'll perform.

560
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,250
The Colosseum!

561
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:33,830
Dumbo will stay in the training tent behind.

562
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:35,500
Dumbo!

563
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:42,590
Why aren't we going with him?

564
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:46,550
Because that is your new home.

565
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:53,140
Wow!

566
00:48:54,350 --> 00:48:55,980
Look at this place!

567
00:48:56,150 --> 00:48:57,440
A library...

568
00:48:57,610 --> 00:48:59,480
"And the children shall lead them."

569
00:48:59,650 --> 00:49:01,530
We're grateful for the opportunity,
Mr. Vandevere.

570
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:03,990
Your family's mine.

571
00:49:06,990 --> 00:49:10,620
You know, I've been brushing up
on your story, Mr. Farrier.

572
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:12,750
Kentucky's top trick rider.

573
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:14,330
Well, there's no reason
you can't be again...

574
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:17,420
only here, you'd be Captain Farrier...

575
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:18,710
war hero.

576
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:22,470
One-armed wonder.

577
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:24,010
National treasure.

578
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:25,720
Wow!

579
00:49:25,890 --> 00:49:27,350
Well, I still can ride.

580
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:28,600
Oh, I know you can.

581
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:30,220
And you're going to.

582
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:33,770
Right after you get that little elephant
off the ground for me.

583
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:35,520
You mean once his act's working?

584
00:49:35,690 --> 00:49:37,230
You're back in the saddle.

585
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:40,320
We're still working on the schedule
for the rest of your troupe...

586
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,360
but on Friday...

587
00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:44,240
we premiere our little Dumbo.

588
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:48,740
I get goose bumps.

589
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:52,620
Why are you looking at me?

590
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:57,830
Well, because the only thing more amazing
than a flying elephant...

591
00:49:58,420 --> 00:49:59,880
is the goddess who can fly it.

592
00:50:01,550 --> 00:50:03,590
Have you lost your mind?

593
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:09,550
Let's not forget from
whence we came, darling.

594
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:13,560
So, we fly Friday!

595
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:17,190
Dumbo's never flown with anyone.

596
00:50:17,810 --> 00:50:22,780
That's why it's become abundantly clear
why we need you.

597
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:25,400
Dumbo!

598
00:50:29,490 --> 00:50:31,330
-Hey, buddy.
-We missed you. You all right?

599
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:34,200
Hey. Captain Farrier is in charge.

600
00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:36,210
No one sees the animal without his approval.

601
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:37,620
Holt.

602
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:39,250
Just call me Holt.

603
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:42,550
I thought you were a military man.

604
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:44,880
Nice boots you bagged there.
What are they, shark skin?

605
00:50:46,090 --> 00:50:47,380
No.

606
00:50:47,930 --> 00:50:50,760
So you better keep your elephant friend
on my good side.

607
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:57,100
Hiya, Dumbo.

608
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:06,110
Dumbo, you mind?

609
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,450
Can I get my arm?

610
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:11,120
And these are the hands
I'll be putting my life in?

611
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:12,910
Welcome.

612
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:16,000
For the record, this was not my idea.

613
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,660
Dumbo works alone.

614
00:51:17,830 --> 00:51:19,290
So do I.

615
00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:22,590
<i>Bonjour,</i> Milly, Joe...

616
00:51:24,090 --> 00:51:25,340
And you...

617
00:51:28,930 --> 00:51:30,340
Charming.

618
00:51:30,510 --> 00:51:33,390
Well, maybe he doesn't recognize you
without your makeup.

619
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:35,850
So I gotta teach you to fly?

620
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:39,770
I know how to fly, ever since I was a child.

621
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:42,650
They taught Dumbo to fly, no?

622
00:51:42,810 --> 00:51:44,520
So I don't need your expertise.

623
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:47,190
All right.

624
00:51:48,610 --> 00:51:50,820
Well, just so you know, I've been to France.

625
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:52,780
It wasn't a good experience.

626
00:51:52,950 --> 00:51:54,660
Show me your secret!

627
00:51:54,830 --> 00:51:56,700
How on earth does your elephant fly?

628
00:51:56,870 --> 00:51:59,160
Well, first,
he needs a feather.

629
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:02,000
He won't fly without a feather.

630
00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:06,210
Well then, neither will I.

631
00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:35,740
Whoa, slow down, princess. Safety first.

632
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:36,870
Guys, nets.

633
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,290
Come on, hurry.

634
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:43,210
All right, guys, good.

635
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:53,760
See, Dumbo?

636
00:52:54,890 --> 00:52:57,010
I fly!

637
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:07,070
See if you can catch me!

638
00:53:10,070 --> 00:53:11,360
Here, Dumbo!

639
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:14,090
We got some work to do.

640
00:54:23,730 --> 00:54:24,770
Friends and colleagues...

641
00:54:24,930 --> 00:54:27,690
let's give a warm Dreamland welcome
to our new executive vice president...

642
00:54:27,850 --> 00:54:28,860
Mr. Max Medici.

643
00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:33,650
Anything he needs, anything at all...

644
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:35,780
make it happen as you always do.

645
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:41,990
This is Miss Verna.

646
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:45,960
She will handle your schedule,
correspondence, and all your calls.

647
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:48,830
When you're needed in meetings,
she'll let you know.

648
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:50,590
Are there meetings today?

649
00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:52,380
I'll let you know!

650
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,550
Mr. Vandevere, one question.

651
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,930
Exactly what do I do?

652
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:05,310
So where'd Vandevere find you?

653
00:55:07,190 --> 00:55:09,020
I was a street performer in Paris.

654
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:11,900
He discovered me.

655
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:13,780
And here I am.

656
00:55:16,190 --> 00:55:17,650
A millionaire's girlfriend.

657
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:19,110
That's a tough break.

658
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:21,990
It's all for show.

659
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:25,200
So you and he, you're not...

660
00:55:25,370 --> 00:55:28,670
I'm one of many gems he wears
to reflect the light back onto him.

661
00:55:32,590 --> 00:55:33,670
Good boy, Dumbo.

662
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:36,090
-Good job.
-Yeah! They're gonna love him.

663
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:37,970
I think you are the lucky one.

664
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:41,890
-Well done, Dumbo.
-Good boy.

665
00:55:42,050 --> 00:55:45,350
Who's been dreaming
like I've been dreaming?

666
00:55:46,850 --> 00:55:49,100
So, how's everything?

667
00:55:49,270 --> 00:55:51,100
-Good?
-We're making progress.

668
00:55:51,270 --> 00:55:52,690
But he ain't quite ready yet.

669
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:55,400
What's the problem?
Doesn't the animal trust you?

670
00:55:55,570 --> 00:55:57,940
-It's not that simple.
<i>-Ma chérie...</i>

671
00:55:58,110 --> 00:56:01,490
we've already sold all the tickets.

672
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:05,280
Maybe our little scientist here
can show us that it's going to work.

673
00:56:18,170 --> 00:56:19,420
Prepare for takeoff.

674
00:56:19,590 --> 00:56:20,840
-Right wing?
-Check!

675
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:23,850
Left wing?

676
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:25,140
Check!

677
00:56:25,850 --> 00:56:27,430
Take her up, Dumbo.

678
00:56:31,850 --> 00:56:33,270
Let's go.

679
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,230
-Come on, buddy. Come on.
-Come on, Dumbo.

680
00:56:37,110 --> 00:56:38,990
That's it.
Come on.

681
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:47,120
Let's try it again.

682
00:56:48,490 --> 00:56:50,330
You got this.
Here you go.

683
00:57:05,090 --> 00:57:07,350
You beautiful one-armed cowboy.

684
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,930
You've made me a child again.

685
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:25,570
<i>Welcome to the Colosseum...</i>

686
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:28,240
<i>where the impossible is possible.</i>

687
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:14,250
<i>Buonasera.</i> Max Medici.

688
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:17,380
I discovered the elephant, my elephant.

689
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:20,340
And basically I said no.
I walked out and that was the end of that.

690
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:21,920
The flying elephant's mine.

691
00:58:22,090 --> 00:58:22,920
Yeah.

692
00:58:24,170 --> 00:58:25,800
You're the guy!

693
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:28,050
You're the guy that's made out of magic dust!

694
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:29,890
Max.

695
00:58:30,050 --> 00:58:32,390
J. Griffin Remington. Atlas Forge Bank.

696
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:34,640
He's the money man.

697
00:58:34,810 --> 00:58:35,810
The J?

698
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:38,900
It's a pleasure to meet you.

699
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:40,060
How are you?

700
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:42,070
You know, they say
the moon is made out of magic dust.

701
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:45,030
That's why they're going to send
a man up there one of these days.

702
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:49,320
And my bank is going to be the bank
that finances the expedition.

703
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:51,160
What do you think of that?

704
00:58:52,490 --> 00:58:53,830
Needless to say, Max...

705
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,660
we all have high hopes for tonight.

706
00:58:55,830 --> 00:58:58,500
Oh, yeah. High hopes.
High hopes.

707
00:58:58,670 --> 00:59:01,920
Well, you know, hopes, and dreams,
that's one thing. That's words.

708
00:59:02,090 --> 00:59:04,130
But what we're talking about here is facts!

709
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:05,380
Plans!

710
00:59:05,550 --> 00:59:07,800
Plans! That takes a lot of money.

711
00:59:07,970 --> 00:59:09,340
Which he hasn't got!

712
00:59:09,510 --> 00:59:12,930
So, we are hoping that your pachyderm
comes through with the goods.

713
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:15,890
Now let's get this show on the road!

714
00:59:22,650 --> 00:59:24,190
We are looking good!

715
00:59:25,570 --> 00:59:26,690
Don't worry, Big D.

716
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:29,070
There's just more room to fly out there,
that's all.

717
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:30,990
Round and round, just like we practiced.

718
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:33,950
And then Dad can talk to Vandevere
about the deal!

719
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:35,290
About the what?

720
00:59:35,450 --> 00:59:36,540
We made a deal with Dumbo.

721
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:39,540
We promised we'd buy his mom back
with all the money he makes for the circus.

722
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:40,920
That's why he flies.

723
00:59:42,130 --> 00:59:43,800
-Joe, not now!
-Are we ready?

724
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:45,880
Yeah.

725
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:54,310
Okay, let's go.

726
00:59:54,470 --> 00:59:56,470
Okay, Dumbo, let's do this.

727
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:57,410
Pink elephants?

728
01:00:57,580 --> 01:00:58,830
So?

729
01:01:57,930 --> 01:02:02,730
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls of all ages!</i>

730
01:02:02,890 --> 01:02:06,850
<i>This is the moment
we've all been waiting for!</i>

731
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:11,280
<i>V.A. Vandevere,
in association with Max Medici...</i>

732
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:15,860
<i>proudly presents,
making his Dreamland debut...</i>

733
01:02:16,030 --> 01:02:18,240
<i>You've seen a horse-fly.</i>

734
01:02:18,410 --> 01:02:20,830
<i>You've seen a dragonfly.</i>

735
01:02:20,990 --> 01:02:23,500
<i>You've even seen a housefly.</i>

736
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:26,000
<i>But you haven't seen anything...</i>

737
01:02:26,170 --> 01:02:29,880
<i>until you see an elephant fly.</i>

738
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:32,960
<i>Let's get ready for Dumbo!</i>

739
01:02:50,270 --> 01:02:51,770
Coming through.

740
01:02:53,150 --> 01:02:54,320
Come on.

741
01:03:13,130 --> 01:03:14,340
He can do it.

742
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:18,130
I know he can.

743
01:03:22,850 --> 01:03:25,060
<i>And here to welcome him...</i>

744
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:29,980
<i>our own Queen of the Heavens!</i>

745
01:04:20,950 --> 01:04:22,570
Dumbo.

746
01:04:23,870 --> 01:04:27,250
Five times around the ring.
That's all we have to do.

747
01:04:28,450 --> 01:04:29,790
Nice and easy, like we practiced.

748
01:04:36,550 --> 01:04:37,550
Dad?

749
01:04:38,210 --> 01:04:39,260
Why aren't they putting up the nets?

750
01:04:42,390 --> 01:04:43,800
Hey, guys?

751
01:04:43,970 --> 01:04:46,060
Guys, what's going on?
Your men are supposed to be out there!

752
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:47,390
Change of plan. From the top.

753
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:00,240
I can't see the nets.

754
01:05:01,110 --> 01:05:02,820
They're invisible.

755
01:05:04,870 --> 01:05:06,700
What's wrong with you? They need nets!

756
01:05:08,910 --> 01:05:09,750
Colette!

757
01:05:09,910 --> 01:05:11,500
Wait, don't take off!

758
01:05:13,170 --> 01:05:14,290
Dumbo...

759
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:15,420
Oh, boy!

760
01:05:15,590 --> 01:05:17,170
...Prince of the Elephants.

761
01:05:19,050 --> 01:05:21,920
I command you to fly with me.

762
01:05:52,910 --> 01:05:54,080
Colette!

763
01:06:10,180 --> 01:06:11,600
Lower the platform!

764
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:31,950
Fly, little one!

765
01:06:51,470 --> 01:06:53,140
Magic dust!

766
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:22,250
Where's my show?

767
01:07:45,070 --> 01:07:47,150
The elephant's headed to Nightmare Island.

768
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:09,720
Come on, sweetie. Let's go.

769
01:08:46,670 --> 01:08:47,670
Dumbo, it's okay.

770
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:48,970
We're here.

771
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:51,880
Good evening.

772
01:08:52,050 --> 01:08:52,890
It's Mr. Vandevere.

773
01:08:53,050 --> 01:08:54,300
-Hello, hi.
-Hey, that's V.A. Vandevere!

774
01:08:54,470 --> 01:08:55,720
Everyone having fun?

775
01:08:56,260 --> 01:08:57,430
Good.

776
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:58,680
-Having a good time?
-Yes, sir.

777
01:08:59,850 --> 01:09:00,980
Fantastic.

778
01:09:01,350 --> 01:09:02,980
Get him outta here.

779
01:09:03,650 --> 01:09:04,980
-Yes.
-Over here!

780
01:09:05,150 --> 01:09:06,400
-Folks, please.
-Hello.

781
01:09:06,570 --> 01:09:08,230
Folks, I need you to leave the exhibit.

782
01:09:09,190 --> 01:09:10,360
Come on.

783
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:13,860
Guys, guys, go easy,
he's just a baby.

784
01:09:14,030 --> 01:09:16,370
Soldier, I give the orders here.

785
01:09:24,170 --> 01:09:25,590
It's his bedtime.

786
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:29,710
<i>This attraction is now closed.</i>

787
01:09:37,060 --> 01:09:38,060
Dad?

788
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:42,270
It's Mrs. Jumbo.

789
01:09:48,110 --> 01:09:51,150
-Come on, I want to see Dumbo!
-I want to see Dumbo!

790
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:52,530
I want my money back!

791
01:09:52,690 --> 01:09:53,950
I don't understand.

792
01:09:54,110 --> 01:09:55,740
The elephant flies. You saw it.

793
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:57,870
I saw a vanishing act.

794
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:01,290
I'm not investing one cent
until I can see this works.

795
01:10:01,450 --> 01:10:03,670
You can't control your animal.

796
01:10:03,830 --> 01:10:06,080
You give me a little time, I can fix this.

797
01:10:06,250 --> 01:10:09,420
Whatever! Till then, the bank is closed.

798
01:10:14,010 --> 01:10:16,180
What happened up there?
You lost control of the animal.

799
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:17,350
You're the animal.

800
01:10:17,510 --> 01:10:18,680
Where was my net?

801
01:10:18,850 --> 01:10:21,100
Nets are for rehearsal.
This is the show.

802
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:26,100
Training?
You call that training?

803
01:10:26,270 --> 01:10:28,820
Now, hold on, Mr. Vandevere,
we know why he flew away.

804
01:10:28,980 --> 01:10:30,730
He recognized that other elephant's call.

805
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:32,820
The one on Nightmare Island.
It's his momma!

806
01:10:32,990 --> 01:10:34,110
It's true. It's her.

807
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:35,910
She was sold from our circus two months ago.

808
01:10:36,070 --> 01:10:37,320
Every child knows its mother.

809
01:10:37,490 --> 01:10:40,080
And they say elephants never forget.

810
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:41,660
They can be together now.

811
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:43,870
Why are there children in my office?

812
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:47,830
Mr. Vandevere, please,
all Dumbo wants is his momma.

813
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,630
Just reunite them,
and he'll do whatever you want.

814
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:53,420
No, he'll do whatever she wants.

815
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:57,550
You think I'd have bought her if I thought
she was related to him?

816
01:10:58,850 --> 01:11:00,470
Doesn't help me at all.

817
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:07,940
You wanna know the most important thing
about growing up?

818
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:13,820
You've got to learn to go it alone.

819
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:19,240
Get rid of the mother.
You know where to take her.

820
01:11:19,410 --> 01:11:20,830
And treat yourself to some new boots.

821
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:23,160
But, sir, you can't just kill her.

822
01:11:23,750 --> 01:11:24,790
Why not?

823
01:11:24,950 --> 01:11:26,120
Mr. Vandevere.

824
01:11:26,290 --> 01:11:28,460
Wait!
Don't separate 'em, please.

825
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:30,500
Don't do that to my kids.

826
01:11:30,670 --> 01:11:34,460
You know, Holt, when my father left us,
it was a blessing really.

827
01:11:34,630 --> 01:11:37,510
Because I had to learn
how to fend for myself.

828
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:39,640
Maybe that's what your children need.

829
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:41,220
Don't tell me what my children need.

830
01:11:41,390 --> 01:11:43,140
Best take a step back, Elephant Man.

831
01:11:45,270 --> 01:11:46,810
Darling...

832
01:11:46,980 --> 01:11:51,060
Dumbo and his mom need a little alone time.

833
01:11:51,230 --> 01:11:53,400
So, Mommy's going to take a little trip...

834
01:11:53,570 --> 01:11:55,740
so that Dumbo won't be distracted.

835
01:11:58,360 --> 01:11:59,240
Milly!

836
01:11:59,410 --> 01:12:00,990
Milly!

837
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:15,050
Colette?

838
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:18,130
I have rehearsal.

839
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:20,720
Max.

840
01:12:26,220 --> 01:12:27,270
<i>Nightmare Island.</i>

841
01:12:27,430 --> 01:12:28,430
Milly?

842
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:30,940
<i>Home of the most dangerous beasts
in the world.</i>

843
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:32,690
Sir, park's closing.

844
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:41,030
Milly!

845
01:12:45,030 --> 01:12:46,040
Milly!

846
01:12:51,210 --> 01:12:52,960
Did you find her?

847
01:12:53,670 --> 01:12:54,710
No.

848
01:12:57,710 --> 01:13:01,630
Well, her momma always knew what to say.
No matter what.

849
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:03,050
She always knew.

850
01:13:04,010 --> 01:13:06,930
Your children don't need you to be perfect.

851
01:13:07,390 --> 01:13:09,730
They just need you to believe in them.

852
01:13:11,310 --> 01:13:12,900
That simple, huh?

853
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:22,530
All right, well,
I'm gonna keep looking.

854
01:13:43,510 --> 01:13:46,140
That's my daughter all right.

855
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:49,270
The only girl I know
who runs away to go to school.

856
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:52,100
It's our fault.

857
01:13:52,270 --> 01:13:54,560
Bet Dumbo wishes he never met us.

858
01:13:54,730 --> 01:13:57,150
You showed him he could fly.

859
01:13:57,320 --> 01:13:59,230
You think he'd ever trade that?

860
01:14:00,110 --> 01:14:02,150
He would to have his mom back.

861
01:14:07,530 --> 01:14:09,080
I miss Momma.

862
01:14:10,950 --> 01:14:12,620
Yeah, so do I.

863
01:14:16,380 --> 01:14:18,380
There's something I want to show you.

864
01:14:19,710 --> 01:14:22,510
<i>With advances in both
engineering and medicine...</i>

865
01:14:22,670 --> 01:14:25,180
<i>the human and the mechanical
will soon be combined...</i>

866
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:28,510
<i>to assist ordinary families, workers
and veterans.</i>

867
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:33,690
<i>All kinds of technological marvels
await us in the 20th century.</i>

868
01:14:34,310 --> 01:14:36,520
You're gonna do great things.

869
01:14:37,770 --> 01:14:38,770
I know it.

870
01:14:49,660 --> 01:14:50,950
What's this?

871
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:52,290
Give me a break.

872
01:14:52,450 --> 01:14:55,540
I gotta teach you how to read English, too?

873
01:15:00,750 --> 01:15:02,510
Oh, Max, hello!

874
01:15:03,670 --> 01:15:05,590
Good, you brought the paperwork.

875
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:06,800
Max...

876
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:10,050
I was reviewing your troupe...

877
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:11,560
and to be honest with you...

878
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:14,930
they're really pale imitations
from the acts we already have.

879
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:18,350
So I was thinking, I don't know,
a month's severance? Seems fair.

880
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:19,940
<i>Capisce?</i>

881
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:23,150
I thought you promised to...

882
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:26,070
Max, the contract says that I'd hire them.

883
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:28,070
It never stipulated for how long.

884
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:31,240
So, get your little band of low-rent freaks
out of here.

885
01:15:31,410 --> 01:15:34,700
But they're my troupe.
They're countin' on me.

886
01:15:34,870 --> 01:15:37,210
Okay, let's have a heart.

887
01:15:37,370 --> 01:15:39,210
Why don't you tell them?

888
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:54,180
‘Bout time, boss.
So, when do we start?

889
01:16:05,230 --> 01:16:06,690
What's going on, guys?

890
01:16:06,860 --> 01:16:08,740
Vandevere's fired them all.

891
01:16:08,910 --> 01:16:10,990
They're to leave by tomorrow.

892
01:16:23,670 --> 01:16:26,010
Goodbye, little friend.

893
01:16:26,630 --> 01:16:28,220
Goodbye.

894
01:16:30,470 --> 01:16:33,220
We wanted to see him one last time.

895
01:16:33,390 --> 01:16:35,770
One last time to see him fly.

896
01:16:36,890 --> 01:16:38,690
I don't think he wants to anymore.

897
01:16:39,310 --> 01:16:41,150
Oh, no. But he must.

898
01:16:41,310 --> 01:16:43,900
He cannot lose Mrs. Jumbo again!

899
01:16:44,070 --> 01:16:46,940
I'm afraid it's rather worse than that.

900
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:48,530
Mr. Sotheby?

901
01:16:49,070 --> 01:16:51,070
I've come to clear my conscience.

902
01:16:51,990 --> 01:16:54,660
I resigned my position as soon
as I heard him give the order.

903
01:16:54,830 --> 01:16:56,240
What order?

904
01:16:57,200 --> 01:17:00,120
Mrs. Jumbo will be gone by tomorrow night.

905
01:17:00,290 --> 01:17:02,130
And she's not meant to survive.

906
01:17:17,850 --> 01:17:19,930
This "Dreamland" doesn't deserve him.

907
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:22,350
No circus does.

908
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:38,620
Well, who's gonna be willing to help me?

909
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:43,290
Set Dumbo and his momma free.

910
01:18:11,530 --> 01:18:16,490
<i>Welcome to the Colosseum,
where the impossible is possible.</i>

911
01:18:18,790 --> 01:18:21,410
Okay. Second time's the charm.

912
01:18:21,580 --> 01:18:24,920
Let's see if Dream Daddy's
worked out the kinks.

913
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:26,960
<i>Here to pick up the elephant
from Nightmare Island?</i>

914
01:18:27,130 --> 01:18:28,040
Confirmed.

915
01:18:28,210 --> 01:18:29,840
Unlock the back gates.

916
01:18:52,860 --> 01:18:54,400
Dumbo in position!

917
01:18:55,660 --> 01:18:58,660
Soon as he flies, you run back to his tent
and I'll find you there.

918
01:18:58,950 --> 01:19:00,160
All right, Big D.

919
01:19:01,620 --> 01:19:03,830
It's all up to you now.

920
01:19:05,370 --> 01:19:06,620
Come on, Holt!

921
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:18,180
To hell with it.

922
01:19:22,770 --> 01:19:24,680
Ready for positions.

923
01:19:24,850 --> 01:19:27,020
We could have used a little rehearsal.

924
01:19:27,190 --> 01:19:28,520
Rehearsal?

925
01:19:28,690 --> 01:19:31,190
Think we got a rehearsal
at the Battle of the Argonne?

926
01:19:32,190 --> 01:19:33,990
You sure you can do this?

927
01:19:34,150 --> 01:19:35,860
I fly elephants all the time.

928
01:19:37,030 --> 01:19:38,740
Are you sure you can do this?

929
01:19:39,660 --> 01:19:41,530
With one hand tied behind my back.

930
01:19:54,260 --> 01:19:56,760
Wait. What's that?

931
01:19:58,220 --> 01:19:59,340
Ma'am?

932
01:20:01,010 --> 01:20:02,060
Ma'am?

933
01:20:02,970 --> 01:20:04,890
Sorry, ma'am, attraction's closed.

934
01:20:05,060 --> 01:20:08,190
My dream... to be a mermaid...

935
01:20:08,350 --> 01:20:10,610
and now they've taken it away.

936
01:20:10,770 --> 01:20:13,150
And yet I hear the water singing.

937
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:14,650
I hear them beckoning me home.

938
01:20:14,820 --> 01:20:16,780
Lady, just be careful, okay?

939
01:20:16,940 --> 01:20:19,160
-Return me to the vast abyss!
-Let's go.

940
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:21,700
-My destiny, the sea!
-Okay.

941
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:12,290
We've lost power!

942
01:21:12,460 --> 01:21:13,790
Even the cages?

943
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:15,420
But the animals...

944
01:21:17,090 --> 01:21:18,920
Find the breakers. Get the lights back on!

945
01:21:19,550 --> 01:21:21,380
And make sure those cages are locked.

946
01:21:40,030 --> 01:21:43,160
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls.</i>

947
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:46,660
<i>Making his second Dreamland debut.</i>

948
01:21:46,910 --> 01:21:49,700
<i>Let's get ready for Dumbo!</i>

949
01:22:49,850 --> 01:22:50,680
Hey!

950
01:22:58,980 --> 01:23:00,900
It's a trick! Get back to the...

951
01:23:16,250 --> 01:23:21,170
<i>And once again, our very own
Queen of the Heavens!</i>

952
01:23:42,730 --> 01:23:43,740
You.

953
01:23:43,900 --> 01:23:46,070
Where is your circus of freaks?

954
01:23:48,450 --> 01:23:49,780
What's going on?

955
01:23:49,950 --> 01:23:52,080
The elephant's mother is gone!

956
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:54,580
His troupe's behind it!

957
01:23:55,080 --> 01:23:57,040
Alert the tower and secure the gates.

958
01:23:57,710 --> 01:23:59,540
Don't let them get out.

959
01:24:01,090 --> 01:24:02,880
But why would they only take the one?

960
01:24:04,260 --> 01:24:07,180
Keep your eye on Farrier and those kids.

961
01:24:07,340 --> 01:24:08,930
You! Come with us.

962
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:24,530
There they are!

963
01:24:26,570 --> 01:24:27,650
Hey!

964
01:24:37,580 --> 01:24:39,000
Hey, you!

965
01:24:39,170 --> 01:24:40,460
What are you doing up there?

966
01:24:40,630 --> 01:24:42,420
That's private property.

967
01:24:42,590 --> 01:24:44,090
Come on! Get down here!

968
01:24:44,250 --> 01:24:45,340
Now!

969
01:24:45,510 --> 01:24:48,760
Hey, I'm Max Medici, Vandevere's partner.

970
01:24:49,050 --> 01:24:52,600
He's just a maintenance man fixing a light!
Get back to your posts!

971
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:54,560
Yes, sir, Mr. Medici.

972
01:25:09,490 --> 01:25:11,320
Let's try this again.

973
01:25:11,490 --> 01:25:12,910
You and me.

974
01:25:28,420 --> 01:25:29,630
Hey, the kids?

975
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:30,800
Where are the kids?

976
01:25:30,970 --> 01:25:32,050
Hey, have you seen the kids?

977
01:25:32,220 --> 01:25:36,220
Dumbo, Prince of the Elephants!

978
01:25:36,390 --> 01:25:39,430
I command you to fly with me.

979
01:25:54,570 --> 01:25:56,990
Dumbo, please fly.

980
01:25:57,950 --> 01:25:59,580
Do it for your momma.

981
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:55,840
Where's your father?

982
01:27:10,070 --> 01:27:10,900
Dumbo!

983
01:27:23,290 --> 01:27:25,120
Hey! Get those kids!

984
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:29,540
Dumbo!

985
01:28:02,620 --> 01:28:03,660
Come on.

986
01:28:04,830 --> 01:28:06,080
There!

987
01:28:27,100 --> 01:28:28,350
Just passing through!

988
01:28:30,020 --> 01:28:31,310
Hey! You can't do that!

989
01:28:34,190 --> 01:28:35,690
Get the elephant!

990
01:28:35,860 --> 01:28:36,990
You get the elephant!

991
01:28:58,930 --> 01:29:02,100
Don't worry. Dad'll be here soon.

992
01:29:02,260 --> 01:29:03,680
Where's the elephant?

993
01:29:10,020 --> 01:29:12,610
Why are you just standing there?
Get to the tower!

994
01:29:12,770 --> 01:29:15,110
Electricity's failing! There's no elevators!

995
01:29:15,270 --> 01:29:17,860
When I last checked,
they invented stairs.

996
01:29:19,110 --> 01:29:22,570
<i>We seem to be experiencing
some technical difficulties.</i>

997
01:29:37,130 --> 01:29:39,590
What happened to my power?

998
01:29:40,590 --> 01:29:42,260
What power, <i>mon chéri?</i>

999
01:29:42,430 --> 01:29:43,930
You ungrateful...

1000
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:47,350
You were nothing before I made you my...

1001
01:29:47,890 --> 01:29:50,480
I believe the word is "queen."

1002
01:29:52,310 --> 01:29:54,060
I need lights!

1003
01:29:56,820 --> 01:29:57,940
Mr. Vandevere, wait!

1004
01:29:58,110 --> 01:30:00,360
We have to reset the mains,
or you could cause a surge!

1005
01:30:00,530 --> 01:30:01,740
Right now it's impossible!

1006
01:30:01,900 --> 01:30:03,910
Nothing's impossible!

1007
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:07,080
Mr. Vandevere!

1008
01:30:13,420 --> 01:30:14,960
Mr. Vandevere, stop!

1009
01:30:40,570 --> 01:30:42,320
Milly! Joe!

1010
01:30:51,290 --> 01:30:53,080
Come on. Go!
Come on!

1011
01:31:19,900 --> 01:31:20,900
Get everyone out!

1012
01:31:21,070 --> 01:31:23,070
Evacuate the park!

1013
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:28,780
Milly! Joe!

1014
01:31:42,130 --> 01:31:43,130
Hey!

1015
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:50,930
Where is the elephant?

1016
01:31:51,100 --> 01:31:52,350
Let her go!

1017
01:32:09,870 --> 01:32:10,870
Come on!

1018
01:32:11,030 --> 01:32:12,160
Milly! Joe!

1019
01:32:12,330 --> 01:32:13,580
Dad!

1020
01:32:13,750 --> 01:32:15,290
-You all right? All right?
-We're fine.

1021
01:32:15,460 --> 01:32:16,830
Okay, come on.
All right, cover your faces.

1022
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,040
Give me your hand!
Come on!

1023
01:32:19,210 --> 01:32:19,880
Back!

1024
01:32:22,210 --> 01:32:23,460
Stay close.

1025
01:32:32,680 --> 01:32:33,890
Come on, everybody.

1026
01:32:34,060 --> 01:32:36,180
Let's get to the seaport!
Now!

1027
01:32:36,680 --> 01:32:38,850
-Where are the Farriers?
-They must still be inside.

1028
01:33:11,590 --> 01:33:12,510
Dad!

1029
01:33:13,470 --> 01:33:14,640
It's okay, Joe.

1030
01:33:16,430 --> 01:33:17,480
Come here. Come here.

1031
01:33:20,310 --> 01:33:30,410
Dumbo!

1032
01:33:30,570 --> 01:33:31,660
Come on!

1033
01:33:32,410 --> 01:33:34,700
-Go! Go! Go! Go!
-Jump!

1034
01:33:35,160 --> 01:33:36,660
Come on. Come on.

1035
01:33:44,750 --> 01:33:46,250
-All right, let's go.
-Stay close, come on.

1036
01:33:49,260 --> 01:33:50,430
Okay. Go! Go! Go!

1037
01:33:50,590 --> 01:33:52,010
Come on!

1038
01:33:52,890 --> 01:33:54,100
-Dumbo!
-Come on!

1039
01:33:55,100 --> 01:33:56,310
Dumbo! What's wrong?

1040
01:33:56,470 --> 01:33:58,350
Guys! Milly! Joe! Come on!

1041
01:33:58,520 --> 01:33:59,680
Dumbo, let's go!

1042
01:34:03,860 --> 01:34:04,860
Go!

1043
01:34:10,030 --> 01:34:11,450
Dumbo!

1044
01:34:11,610 --> 01:34:13,320
Get him!

1045
01:34:13,490 --> 01:34:15,620
He's seen us.
Dumbo, you gotta go.

1046
01:34:15,780 --> 01:34:17,160
They're comin' for you.
You gotta go, Dumbo.

1047
01:34:17,330 --> 01:34:18,410
He lost the feather.

1048
01:34:18,580 --> 01:34:21,330
Feather doesn't do nothin'.
Dumbo, you don't need the feather to fly.

1049
01:34:21,870 --> 01:34:23,420
Dad, they're coming!

1050
01:34:24,170 --> 01:34:25,630
Stand back! Stand back!

1051
01:34:25,790 --> 01:34:26,790
Out of my way!

1052
01:34:29,010 --> 01:34:30,920
Dumbo, remember this?

1053
01:34:31,090 --> 01:34:33,050
From my momma?

1054
01:34:33,220 --> 01:34:36,930
I can unlock any door.
And you can, too.

1055
01:34:37,930 --> 01:34:39,470
But I don't need this key to do it.

1056
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:40,930
And you don't need the feather.

1057
01:34:42,440 --> 01:34:43,270
Come on.

1058
01:34:58,660 --> 01:34:59,580
Dad!

1059
01:34:59,740 --> 01:35:00,830
Gotta go. Come on!

1060
01:35:02,910 --> 01:35:05,000
-What are you doing?
-There ain't room for the three of us.

1061
01:35:05,170 --> 01:35:06,880
You get him to the seaport
and I'll see you there.

1062
01:35:07,340 --> 01:35:08,540
Go on, Big D.

1063
01:35:14,930 --> 01:35:16,050
Grab 'em!

1064
01:35:16,220 --> 01:35:17,220
Hey!

1065
01:35:23,980 --> 01:35:25,400
Hey!

1066
01:35:27,110 --> 01:35:29,020
That's my elephant!

1067
01:35:42,660 --> 01:35:44,210
They're safe.

1068
01:35:44,370 --> 01:35:45,960
Come on, let's go!

1069
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:50,290
Hey! Get back here!

1070
01:35:53,630 --> 01:35:55,300
You freak!
What have you done?

1071
01:35:55,720 --> 01:35:57,010
What they pay me for, mister.

1072
01:35:57,180 --> 01:35:58,640
Put on a hell of a show.

1073
01:36:02,220 --> 01:36:03,430
Hey! Him!

1074
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:05,640
Right there, arrest that man.
He stole my elephant.

1075
01:36:05,810 --> 01:36:07,560
Hey, we had a contract, Medici!

1076
01:36:08,020 --> 01:36:11,230
I'm no expert,
but I think you got bigger problems here.

1077
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:25,250
Wow. This is a disaster.

1078
01:36:26,370 --> 01:36:27,750
Come on, I'll buy you a hot dog.

1079
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:29,880
Sounds good, J.G.

1080
01:37:09,540 --> 01:37:11,830
Last call for cargo!

1081
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,590
All aboard!

1082
01:37:35,730 --> 01:37:37,190
Colette!

1083
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:46,660
Where's your father?

1084
01:37:46,830 --> 01:37:48,960
Don't worry.
He'll be here.

1085
01:37:55,460 --> 01:37:56,550
Dad!

1086
01:37:56,710 --> 01:37:58,630
I knew you could ride.

1087
01:38:04,850 --> 01:38:07,020
-Pramesh, we have to go.
-Please, hurry.

1088
01:38:08,310 --> 01:38:10,230
Hurry! Come on! Hurry!

1089
01:38:11,940 --> 01:38:13,100
Come.

1090
01:38:13,900 --> 01:38:15,570
Let's go home.

1091
01:38:31,620 --> 01:38:32,790
Hey!

1092
01:38:55,400 --> 01:38:57,400
Well, get out of here,
you little troublemaker.

1093
01:38:59,980 --> 01:39:00,990
Go on.

1094
01:39:41,110 --> 01:39:42,820
Ladies and gentlemen...

1095
01:39:42,990 --> 01:39:47,160
introducing our world-famous flying elephant.

1096
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:58,330
Welcome to the Medici Family circus!

1097
01:39:58,500 --> 01:40:03,340
Where we believe no wild animals
shall be held in captivity.

1098
01:40:10,810 --> 01:40:12,520
See Rongo...

1099
01:40:12,680 --> 01:40:16,100
the world's strongest and most versatile man.

1100
01:40:18,020 --> 01:40:21,190
Meet the bewitching Miss Atlantis...

1101
01:40:21,360 --> 01:40:27,860
now performing underwater Shakespeare,
with the world's only living merman, Puck!

1102
01:40:33,950 --> 01:40:38,620
And visit our newest attraction,
Milly Farrier's World of Wonders...

1103
01:40:38,790 --> 01:40:45,090
to discover all the real-life amazements
that are shaping tomorrow today!

1104
01:41:02,770 --> 01:41:06,990
Marvel at the skills of the legendary Holt...

1105
01:41:07,150 --> 01:41:09,860
our cowboy of the future!

1106
01:41:24,920 --> 01:41:28,170
And the Pearl of Paris, Colette.

1107
01:41:28,340 --> 01:41:31,140
Queen of the Heavens!

1108
01:41:55,030 --> 01:41:58,790
Friends, young and old,
you have a home at our circus.

1109
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:02,420
Where anything is possible
and miracles happen.

1110
01:42:02,580 --> 01:42:04,130
Believe me, they do.
