1597, Second Japanese Invasion

6
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,045
<i>Accused by a Japanese double agent,</i>

7
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,968
<i>Admiral Yi Sun-shin is relieved
of command and tortured.</i>

8
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,486
<i>In July, Joseon's navy is
decimated in Chilcheollyang.</i>

9
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,561
<i>Japan's army advances mercilessly,</i>

10
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,122
<i>capturing two crucial regions in August,</i>

11
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:50,445
<i>and setting its sights on the capital.</i>

12
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:57,927
<i>King Seonjo quickly pardons and reinstates Yi,</i>

13
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,926
<i>who immediately rallies his
remaining warships and troops.</i>

14
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:09,371
<i>He obtains 12 ships that escaped
the battle of Chilcheollyang,</i>

15
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,081
<i>and encamps on the Southern Sea.</i>

16
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,325
<i>Just 20km away in Haenam,
Japan's navy sets up base,</i>

17
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:24,646
<i>preparing to attack with over 300 ships.</i>

18
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,964
So, Admiral,

19
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,966
when will you join them?

20
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,571
What do you mean?

21
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,885
As per royal order, of course.

22
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:12,090
Your orders are to join
forces with ground troops

23
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,044
under General Gwon Yul.

24
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,167
Is that what it says?

25
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,047
What?

26
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,245
With all due respect,

27
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,165
the enemy has over 200 ships!

28
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,649
Our men are deserting their posts!

29
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,964
The number of deserters has reached...

30
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,365
50...

31
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,770
I must ease my mind.

32
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,530
200 enemy ships could
invade at any moment!

33
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,804
What strategy...

34
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:02,449
have you in mind to repel them?

35
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,368
Let's hear from the young officers!

36
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,885
Do we stand a chance?

37
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,842
Do we?

38
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,451
Don't save your breath!

39
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,491
Admiral.

40
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,728
Please help us erase all doubt.

41
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,010
Aside from a damaged turtle ship,
what plan is in place?

42
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,526
You're addressing our commander!

43
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,725
How dare you!

44
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,961
I'm your ranking officer!

45
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,485
Shut your mouth and listen!

46
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,164
You have no right!

47
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,448
You're merely a deserter
who fled from Chilcheollyang!

48
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,760
Boy, we possess those 12 ships,

49
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,843
because I got out from
that doomed battle.

50
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,128
Know when to open your mouth.

51
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,722
Admiral, you know as well as
anyone that this battle is futile.

52
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:20,610
I saw firsthand the brutality
and strength of our foes!

53
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,162
10,000 men were lost!

54
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,083
Will you knowingly send
the rest of our men to their graves?

55
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,122
This briefing is adjourned.

56
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,811
Dismissed.

57
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,246
Admiral!

58
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,163
He gave an order!

59
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,804
Everyone out.

60
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,047
Our priority is to repair
the ships and train our men!

61
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,602
Now!

62
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,645
We must capture King Seonjo
and end this war.

63
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:00,362
He mustn't slip through
our fingers like before.

64
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,560
We must coordinate,
like a perfect storm!

65
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,527
Prepare at ONCE!

66
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,681
Yes, commander.

67
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:13,047
We can't allow Konishi
to dethrone Joseon first.

68
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:19,286
But Chancellor Hideyoshi
wants us to wait for his man.

69
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,890
So we have no choice.

70
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,527
Aren't those Wakizaka's ships?

71
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,969
Yes, back from reconnaissance.

72
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,843
How many trips?

73
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,923
Three, including last night's.

74
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,611
But sir,

75
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,530
who is the chancellor sending us?

76
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:01,450
Someone essential
to this battle, I'm told.

77
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,690
One who can overpower Yi Sun-shin.

78
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,402
General

79
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:30,000
It is futile to battle such a formidable foe. I command
you to disband the navy and join Gwon Yul's army.

80
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,211
Father! Father!

81
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,965
Captain Bae tried,
but they're gonna kill him!

82
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,803
He had to!

83
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,645
We'll die anyway!

84
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,045
Father! Father!

85
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,847
I will...

86
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,846
have your head!

87
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,848
Forgive me for interfering.

88
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,363
I couldn't simply pass by.

89
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,081
Are you the one sent by the chancellor?

90
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,726
It's the navy from Ehime Prefecture.

91
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,491
They're not navy.

92
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,649
Pirates, more like.

93
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,280
Let's move.

94
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,521
Deployment imminent

95
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,602
It's swarming with activity.

96
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,326
Over 200 warships are docked,

97
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,527
supply ships are being loaded,

98
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,526
and they're stealing
provisions from villagers.

99
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,724
They cut off the nose
of any who resist,

100
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,731
and use children for target practice.

101
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,563
It seems as if...

102
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,600
they're on the verge of deployment.

103
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,682
Is it true that

104
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,769
25,000 Japanese reinforcement
soldiers are en route?

105
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,927
Yes, it appears so.

106
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,289
They act like our navy does not exist,

107
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:50,207
and talk of swarming the capital,
like it was nothing at all.

108
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,602
We must do something,

109
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,768
or the capital will run with blood.

110
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,926
Deliver this to Junsa and
return with his report.

111
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,611
At once, sir.

112
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,604
The figurehead is complete!

113
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,004
The figurehead is complete!

114
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,927
Turtle ship's figurehead!

115
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,800
Sweetheart.

116
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,210
Another talisman?

117
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,570
This isn't my first mission.

118
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,484
But I'll treasure it.

119
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,245
I'm off.

120
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,410
Take care of yourself!

121
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:45,007
Is Yi disobeying
the royal order again?

122
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,687
He pursues what he feels
is a logical path.

123
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,730
If he disobeys the royal order,
I cannot guarantee his safety.

124
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,291
The southern provinces have fallen.

125
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,807
Japan's ground
forces are northbound.

126
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:01,283
If their navy should also reach
the capital via the southern sea,

127
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,441
what would happen?

128
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,365
But what can he do
with a measly 12 ships?!

129
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,126
How can 12 measly ships
reinforce the army?

130
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,805
Don't mince words!

131
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,208
I know he's not even in good health!

132
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,249
And who's responsible for that?

133
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,130
You son of a...

134
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,643
Do you even know the situation here?

135
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,931
The infamous Kiyomasa is
knocking at our gate.

136
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:33,525
Ergo! We need every
able body still standing!

137
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,408
Grab him!

138
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,762
Grab him!

139
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,443
LBt go!

140
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,087
LBt go!

141
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,921
Please general,
grant us men and weapons.

142
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,888
The navy is facing a Goliath!

143
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,484
So obey the royal order.

144
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:03,171
Will you ignore the admiral's
earnest request?

145
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,848
How dare you!

146
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,730
You are out of line!

147
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,163
What are you all waiting for?

148
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,049
Take him away and
lock him up this instant!

149
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,565
General!

150
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,161
General!

151
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,886
Please!

152
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,327
The admiral wishes
to convey these words!

153
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:25,370
"To forfeit the sea is to forfeit Joseon!"

154
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,082
General! General!

155
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,962
I've waited half a day.

156
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:45,166
Is this how you treat your guest?

157
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,404
We were too focused on
the war briefing

158
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,880
to give attention to our guest.

159
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,691
I beg your forgiveness.

160
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:07,971
By the way, how do pirates

161
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,243
usually kill a king?

162
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,169
Please enlighten us.

163
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,602
I've surveyed the region.

164
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:31,003
If we ride the morning
tide in the strait,

165
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,606
we can resupply the troops by night,

166
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,251
and sail into the capital.

167
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,609
We'll be there in a day and a half.

168
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,447
Easier said than done.

169
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,204
Yi Sun-shin is not a feeble adversary.

170
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,086
Sailing the open sea,

171
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,009
and approaching the capital

172
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,767
to annihilate Yi with
the army is the best strategy.

173
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:16,644
Why do you think
Hideyoshi sent me, Wakizaka?

174
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,327
How dare you utter his name!

175
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:50,963
I will crush Yi with this hand.

176
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,611
Will you allow Konishi
to walk into the capital first?

177
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,369
I've committed a grave mistake.

178
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:16,203
Please forgive my men.

179
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:21,487
Sit with me, Kurushima.

180
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:41,611
One swing of this sword, blood will spread

181
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,330
Mother...

182
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,842
Father, it's Hoe.

183
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,524
It's nice to be with you.

184
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,727
Yes, sir.

185
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,727
Father.

186
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,010
Speak freely.

187
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,131
Perhaps this is a blessing in disguise.

188
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,727
Why not blame ailing
health and return home?

189
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,729
We haven't held a proper
funeral for grandmother.

190
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,371
Only a temporary shrine.

191
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,283
Allow our men to join the army,

192
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,930
and say you can no longer
fulfill your duties.

193
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,490
I feel your resentment
towards our king.

194
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,925
The king tried to take your life.

195
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,446
How could you not feel resentment?

196
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,087
Father.

197
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,401
Our fleet is but 12 ships.

198
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,964
It is shameful to call
ourselves a navy.

199
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,246
Even if...

200
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:25,328
you somehow lead
these men to victory,

201
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,361
the king will surely abandon you.

202
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,683
What are you fighting for?

203
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,481
For loyalty.

204
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,641
To that...

205
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,250
...impudent king?

206
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,930
It is said,

207
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,370
a commander's loyalty
must lie with the king,

208
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:54,647
and the king must follow his subjects.

209
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,124
Not himself?

210
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,045
The people build a nation.

211
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,682
Only then can a king exist.

212
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,250
Even if...

213
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:11,770
those people care about nothing
more than their own lives?

214
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,282
Eat your meal, it's precious food.

215
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,771
Make way!

216
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,483
Admiral.

217
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,890
Stay away to avoid beheading

218
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,083
Look... look at this...

219
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,763
That's Captain Bae Hong-suk!

220
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,682
He led the flagship!

221
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,802
Do not enter

222
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,247
Get them out of here!

223
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,321
Get them out!

224
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,121
Get out from there!

225
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,281
Now!

226
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,370
June 7th Kurushima
Michifusa 25 years

227
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,449
Did you behead the prisoners
and send them back?

228
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,846
After cutting off their noses and ears.

229
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:12,445
Have you a death wish?

230
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,647
Why provoke the enemy
with this senseless act?

231
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,760
Why not? It'll be an interesting fight.

232
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,810
But...

233
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:34,208
will they fight?

234
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,246
Yi Sun-shin is not a foe to take lightly!

235
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:46,723
<i>1 hear some of your men
revere 'H's prowess.</i>

236
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,521
Perhaps the defeat in Hansan

237
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,322
has shriveled your balls?

238
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,000
How dare you?

239
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,207
Let me be clear.

240
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,963
Why do you think
the chancellor sent me?

241
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,124
It's because of men like you
who tremble at Yi's name.

242
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,091
Don't draw your sword so recklessly.

243
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:40,001
Your head may be the first to fall.

244
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:02,841
My brother Michiyuki became
minion to the chancellor,

245
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:08,087
and died on his quest
to conquer Joseon.

246
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:14,562
With me facing the chancellor's wrath,
he joined this war to save me,

247
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:18,451
<i>and died by 'H's hand.</i>

248
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:25,043
The chancellor is ill,
he has a year at most.

249
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:29,564
That's why he's rushing this campaign.

250
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,325
Joseon, which he so desires,

251
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,681
will fall to me.

252
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:48,564
That is why Yi must perish.

253
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,329
Do you understand, Haru?

254
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,884
Perhaps this will also be

255
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,811
proper revenge for my brother.

256
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,130
Why did he do it?

257
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,245
Isn't that Oh Sang-go?

258
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,767
He got caught trying to flee!

259
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,081
It is! It's Sang-go!

260
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,489
He was captured near
Blood Isle while fleeing.

261
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:49,202
My comrades of 6 years
all died in Chilcheollyang.

262
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,244
Today I buried them
with my own hands...

263
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,285
I couldn't help myself.

264
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,484
Now, my turn will come.

265
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,561
Must all of us...

266
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,250
die in vain?

267
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,121
Are you finished?

268
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,204
Discipline stands!

269
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,129
In any situation!

270
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,804
Is that clear?

271
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,962
There's no way out now.

272
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,926
He'll kill even his own.

273
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,169
There is...

274
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,208
always a way.

275
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,041
As the bottleneck of the strait,

276
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,247
the current is very strong here.

277
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,609
They say it is so treacherous,
nothing can escape.

278
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,321
Is it here, sir?

279
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:37,482
Sir, we can assume that
they'll only enter this strait

280
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,165
if they see it as an advantage.

281
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,805
Look at those waves.

282
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:48,401
They'll ride those waves
and ram into our ships.

283
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,688
We don't stand a chance.

284
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,809
That's why we need the turtle ship.

285
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,041
Use it to break the front line,

286
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:59,647
and our warships can fire
cannons from a distance.

287
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,883
It takes half a day
for the tide to change,

288
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,565
will the turtle ship hold?

289
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:21,442
When the tide changes,
the sea calms considerably.

290
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,811
But that sound...

291
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,804
has changed from what is was before.

292
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:35,922
It is like the sound of
a man's howling.

293
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,250
The real problem is the whirlpool.

294
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:47,924
You rarely hear the sound
during high tide.

295
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,605
But if somehow
you should hear it then,

296
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,602
a giant whirlpool appears.

297
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:58,163
High tide comes in 2 days,

298
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,166
and so it could only mean...

299
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,088
Do you hear it?

300
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,886
I hear that sound...

301
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:37,044
as the howling of men
lost in Chilcheollyang.

302
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:45,169
Is the turtle ship your only tactic?

303
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,007
Tactics are not the problem.

304
00:32:52,640 --> 00:33:01,765
It's the fear that is spreading
among my men like a virus.

305
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,123
Is there a way to overcome it?

306
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,690
What are we to do if we cannot?

307
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:28,041
Is beheading our own men,
like this morning,

308
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,964
the only means of discipline?

309
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,121
Can we achieve victory that way?

310
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,126
But you...

311
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,441
We can use it.

312
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,085
YOU mean...

313
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,646
the fear?

314
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,689
Admiral...

315
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,803
It is unjust...

316
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,410
Admiral...

317
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,723
Avenge us...

318
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,367
Avenge us...

319
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,688
So good to see you.

320
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,686
Welcome, Hong-suk.

321
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,567
Captain Choi, Captain Lee...

322
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,086
Avenge us...

323
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,084
Come...

324
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,490
accept my drink.

325
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,211
Please take this drink.

326
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,361
Men...

327
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,407
Where are you going?

328
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,765
Captain Lee...

329
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:43,482
Hong-suk...

330
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,250
Please!

331
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:52,288
Why must you rush off?

332
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,448
Father!

333
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,888
The turtle ship's on fire!

334
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,441
Admiral!

335
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,362
It's General Bae Seol's first mate.

336
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,007
Put out the fire!

337
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,569
Hurry!

338
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,485
Put it out!

339
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,650
Bring water!

340
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,806
Over there!

341
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,323
Hear me!

342
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,246
Don't you want to live?!

343
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:30,086
A dying man...

344
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,890
is leading us to the gates of Hell!

345
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,480
But, I...

346
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,241
...have found a way out!

347
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,888
Do not senselessly
throw away your lives!

348
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,322
So join me!

349
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,050
NO...

350
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,362
Can't be...

351
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,361
Admiral, it's too dangerous!

352
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,646
Please no!

353
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,005
No!

354
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,130
It can't be!

355
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,523
No!

356
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,888
- Admiral!
- Let me go!

357
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,201
No!

358
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,211
Our turtle ship!

359
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,091
Father, it's all over!

360
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,411
There's nothing we can do!

361
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,244
Only one day from completion!

362
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,483
I will face them with this turtle ship!

363
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,208
No!

364
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,411
Commander Todo! Commander Todo!

365
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,724
Yi's turtle ship has burned.

366
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,207
What?

367
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:50,524
A scout was sent after spotting
fire and smoke from Yi's base,

368
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:54,047
and the ship is now ashes!

369
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,003
It was his last turtle
ship, was it not?

370
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,968
YES.

371
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,760
Yi does not have any turtle ships left.

372
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,451
Taito mumun...

373
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:19,082
"Do not look back when
the only course is forward."

374
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:25,964
I feel your great resolve
in the calligraphy.

375
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:35,244
This is the spirit
we need at this junction.

376
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,606
Prepare for battle!

377
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,729
Prepare for battle!

378
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,686
Junsa... where are you...

379
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,205
What happened here?

380
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,884
Help!

381
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,247
Grab him!

382
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,645
Get him!

383
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,491
Please! Help me!

384
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,005
Help me!

385
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,171
Hurry LIP!

386
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,245
Find the other one!

387
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,360
Find him!

388
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,366
Hurry LIP!

389
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,605
March!

390
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,969
I'm from a fishing village,

391
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:35,409
and I can row very well!

392
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,922
Really good rower! One of the best!
What's he jabbering?

393
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,847
What the hell?

394
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,207
Ski-bong!

395
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,489
You little rat!

396
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,490
Wait! I'm sorry!

397
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:01,162
Please don't kill me!

398
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,286
Calm down!

399
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,125
Whirlpool...

400
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,370
Turtle ship...

401
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,651
Father!

402
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,442
Father!

403
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,005
A message from Junsa!

404
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,929
We'll reach Myeongnyang
tomorrow morning.

405
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:56,450
We deploy with the tide,
and the fleet is over 330 ships.

406
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:01,571
Captain of the vanguard is,
unfortunately, someone new.

407
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:05,724
His name is Kurushima,
known as the Pirate King,

408
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,722
and versed in similar conditions.

409
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:12,044
Fortunately, backing him up
is General Wakizaka,

410
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:14,088
whom you defeated in Hansan.

411
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,321
I hope you find some comfort in this.

412
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:20,041
I will join you once I fulfill my duty.

413
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,690
Let's go to Usuyeong.

414
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:29,809
- Sir?
- We cannot fight with the strait behind us.

415
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:32,451
We must move our men now!

416
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,725
To war!

417
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:11,247
Run as fast as the wind,
stand still as the trees

418
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:31,205
A message from General Konishi.

419
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,962
He's pressing me.

420
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:44,443
We will reach the king before him.

421
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,728
We're ready for deployment.

422
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:52,008
Joseon looks particularly savory today.

423
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,402
I like this land.

424
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:15,008
Captain.

425
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,480
Status.

426
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,251
All prepared, sir.

427
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,888
There are only POWs below deck,

428
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,451
and we've stockpiled the gunpowder.

429
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,327
Yi Sun-shin...

430
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:34,003
will not survive this.

431
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:58,926
To war!

432
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,563
Not even a turtle ship!

433
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:19,121
Does a single line formation
even qualify as a tactic?!

434
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,963
Has the admiral gone mad?

435
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:21,882
He's right!

436
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:23,769
Just listen to that!

437
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:26,048
We can't all die in vain.

438
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:28,567
We must come up with a new plan!

439
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:29,925
A new plan!

440
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,400
And what could that be?

441
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:36,606
Could you be implying that
we assassinate the admiral?

442
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,206
No!

443
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:42,248
That's not what I'm saying!

444
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,641
Time is of the essence,

445
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:48,766
and we can't even send
a message up the ranks.

446
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:51,922
Let's go to him.

447
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:55,527
To who?

448
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:05,247
I'll convince the admiral, if not...

449
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,404
I'll offer up my life instead.

450
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:17,130
<i>Your Majesty,</i>

451
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:22,162
<i>if you disband the navy now,</i>

452
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:29,005
<i>I'm afraid the enemy will
reach you unimpeded.</i>

453
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:35,408
<i>I still have 12 ships at my command.</i>

454
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:41,725
<i>If we fight to our last breath,
it is not impossible.</i>

455
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,441
<i>As long as I still breathe...</i>

456
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:03,928
<i>the enemy shall never
feel safe on our soil.</i>

457
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:28,808
Admiral.

458
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:33,650
At the risk of my own life,
I'd like to speak my mind.

459
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:38,925
Sir!

460
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,609
This battle is futile!

461
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:43,960
It's futile!

462
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:47,846
Even if we lure the enemy
into the narrow strait,

463
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:52,410
we cannot face them
without a single turtle ship!

464
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,563
Save this battle
for another day! Please!

465
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:56,721
Please!

466
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,526
Is that how you really feel?

467
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:17,166
Please take my life,
if you believe otherwise.

468
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:20,808
I'd rather die by your sword!

469
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:43,162
If that is how you feel, very well.

470
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:48,806
Gather all the men
in front of the camp.

471
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,247
Yes, sir!

472
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:58,649
Yes, sir!

473
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:10,847
General

474
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,889
Captains Kim and Hwang,
have you brought it?

475
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,086
Yes, admiral!

476
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:29,446
Pour it!

477
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:36,362
What are you waiting for?

478
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:39,164
- Pour it!
- Yes, sir!

479
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:52,721
Light it!

480
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:53,926
Sir!

481
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:55,487
Admiral Yi!

482
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:11,641
Stand back!

483
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:23,202
It's shameful that you still
only consider your own lives!

484
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:26,522
Death...

485
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:30,683
is unavoidable!

486
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:35,890
Is avoiding combat
the path to survival?

487
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:39,607
Will we be safe on land?

488
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,090
Behold!

489
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:51,324
I am burning this land
so that I can die at sea.

490
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:58,291
This is where we stand and fight!

491
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,207
Do not hold onto life!

492
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:10,242
If you crave life, you will surely die!

493
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:14,089
If you fight to the death, you will live!

494
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:23,003
One man at the strategic point
can fend off a thousand men!

495
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:30,362
Those words were spoken
to describe our situation now!

496
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:05,680
<i>Father.</i>

497
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:12,602
<i>How will you utilize
this cancerous fear?</i>

498
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:36,246
Is this Captain Bae Hong-suk's son?

499
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:37,846
Yes, sir.

500
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:41,562
He brought Junsa's message
instead of our scout.

501
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,881
Junsa encountered him
by chance and helped him escape.

502
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:00,047
This was your father's.

503
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:03,970
Will you accept it?

504
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:16,885
What is your name?

505
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,325
Bae Su-bong, sir.

506
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,009
With your father by my side,

507
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:27,490
we fought for 6 years.

508
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:32,201
I will not forget your
father and your names.

509
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,040
I...

510
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,171
I have a request, sir.

511
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:51,647
Go on.

512
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:56,050
Please allow me to board
your ship and fight for you!

513
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:04,449
Only if you'll take an oar
rather than a sword.

514
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:06,481
Thank you.

515
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:07,927
Thank you!

516
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,731
<i>Mother.</i>

517
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:17,930
<i>I must be off now.</i>

518
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:29,801
<i>My only wish is that
our death will not be in vain.</i>

519
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:53,522
Admiral.

520
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,211
Good work.

521
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:58,887
We offer you our assistance.

522
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:03,243
It is greatly appreciated.

523
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:10,121
Admiral!

524
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:16,481
Junsa, thank you.

525
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:50,568
Full deployment.

526
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:57,244
Full deployment!

527
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:10,406
Let's go to war!

528
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:13,361
Deploy!

529
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:16,247
Deploy!

530
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:19,805
Battle formation.

531
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:42,602
The current's pushing us back!
Row harder!

532
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:45,486
Drum louder!

533
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:55,725
Load the cannons!

534
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:19,609
We must hold our position!

535
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:22,127
Row harder!

536
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:51,405
Get rid of it.

537
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:43,885
- Look!
- What is that?

538
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:45,609
What's that black mass?

539
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:09,483
Our fleet!

540
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:15,044
Close the lid!

541
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:20,011
Su-bong, I think
we boarded the wrong ship.

542
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,968
Didn't know it was the flagship?

543
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:26,440
But why must the flagship
be at the front?!

544
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:33,202
I'll order our fleet to
remain in formation!

545
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:36,521
Let them be.

546
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:39,642
Sir? But admiral...

547
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:42,491
Lower the anchor
and prepare for battle.

548
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:50,767
Lower the anchor!

549
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:23,171
Why isn't Yi raising his command flag?

550
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:25,844
Just look at them.

551
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:30,083
Even if he did, would
his men follow him?

552
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:38,327
Vanguard 1, advance.

553
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:40,482
Vanguard 1!

554
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:42,843
Advance!

555
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:13,248
Rotate starboard
and prepare the cannons.

556
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:15,288
Prepare the cannons!

557
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:18,968
Starboard oars, stop!

558
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:22,481
Port oars, row faster!

559
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:33,087
Lieutenant Nah!

560
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:34,286
Captain Song!

561
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:38,481
Aim all cannons and explosive
arrows at their vanguard ships!

562
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:39,682
Yes, sir!

563
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:43,810
Aim the cannons at the vanguard!

564
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:45,962
Archers, battle station!

565
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:47,567
Aim!

566
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:57,921
Prepare to fire!

567
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:01,611
Ready!

568
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:03,801
Fire!

569
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:33,167
The current is picking up,
steer carefully!

570
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:34,161
Ready to fire!

571
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:47,244
- Fire!
- Fire!

572
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:14,287
Now!

573
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:31,287
Increase speed and rotate to port!

574
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:42,045
Fire!

575
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:59,806
Watch out!

576
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:13,883
Fire!

577
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:35,485
Yi is concentrating attack
on the front line.

578
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:39,003
Vanguard ships are
colliding into one another.

579
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:43,244
Yi's holding his position.

580
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:46,966
Could he be waiting for something?

581
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:50,123
Shouldn't we join the assault
and reinforce the front?

582
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:54,926
NO...

583
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:57,441
Wait a little longer.

584
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:08,924
Fear does not discriminate,
it can equally affect our enemy.

585
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:15,051
Six years of defeat have
planted fear in their men, too.

586
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:18,840
Fear does not discriminate...

587
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:26,851
Is that all?

588
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:29,723
Is that how we use fear?

589
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:36,249
If only we can turn fear into courage.

590
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:50,447
Send in vanguard 2, and press harder.

591
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,807
Vanguard 2!

592
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:55,570
Advance!

593
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:03,045
Kurushima keeps sending in ships.

594
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:06,569
He's very skilled
in handling strong tides.

595
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:09,370
Let's wait and see.

596
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,325
Just watch.

597
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:20,163
The current is on our side.

598
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:23,643
We will demolish them.

599
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:45,650
Admiral! Due to the current,
our accuracy has gone down!

600
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,047
Cut the anchor lose.

601
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:51,889
Ride the current towards Blood Isle.

602
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:54,646
Right away!

603
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:12,447
They're trapped.

604
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:13,805
Fire!

605
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:24,371
Get the poles!

606
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:31,529
Port oars, row harder!

607
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:33,807
We mustn't hit the rocks!

608
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:40,966
Sir! We must alert our fleet!

609
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:43,486
We won't last long
at our current position!

610
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:48,331
Switch to shrapnel shells.

611
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:52,731
And prepare for close combat.

612
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:02,566
Get ready!

613
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:05,967
For close combat!

614
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:14,241
Now!

615
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:26,241
Fire!

616
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:56,325
Board!

617
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:05,126
Kurushima is about to win the battle!

618
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:09,041
Yi held his ground long enough.

619
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:22,042
We're all going to die!

620
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:27,168
Admiral!

621
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:53,608
Admiral!

622
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:58,602
Gather all cannons
to the port oar of the ship.

623
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:00,371
Can you do it?

624
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:05,451
But we could all die!

625
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:07,010
Just get it done!

626
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:12,087
Yes, sir! It will be done!

627
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,206
Hold your ground!

628
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:29,488
Place cannons on port oar opening!

629
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:31,160
What are you waiting for?!

630
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:33,640
Get the shells!

631
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,241
- It's too dangerous, don't do it!
- Hurry up!

632
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,163
Gather the shells and gunpowder!

633
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:08,685
On the double!

634
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:36,971
One swing of this sword,
blood will spread

635
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:48,845
Admiral!

636
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:51,486
We're ready!

637
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:56,440
Brace yourselves!

638
01:22:57,440 --> 01:22:59,761
Brace yourselves!

639
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:01,569
Hit the deck!

640
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:23,967
Is that how we use fear?

641
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:30,045
If only we can turn fear into courage...

642
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:39,966
It will inspire even more courage.

643
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:43,691
But father...

644
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:51,329
How can we possibly inspire
such courage in our men?

645
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:58,161
I must be sacrificed.

646
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:10,045
Could this be...

647
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:12,328
the end?

648
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:25,688
Look!

649
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,968
The flagship survived!

650
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:03,008
It's still standing!

651
01:25:07,480 --> 01:25:09,801
The flagship survived!

652
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:18,451
Destroy the enemy!

653
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:27,490
Sons of bitches!

654
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:30,044
I'll kill them all!

655
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:32,129
I want to kill, too!

656
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:01,643
Full speed ahead!

657
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:03,490
Full speed ahead!

658
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:34,800
Whirlpool...

659
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:38,451
It's the whirlpool...

660
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:43,646
Yi Sun-shin...

661
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:57,605
So there was a reason
why you were holding out there.

662
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:02,245
The current has changed,
a large whirlpool is forming!

663
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:05,642
Thanks to that, the water
near the isle is calm,

664
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:08,120
which greatly increases their accuracy.

665
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:13,930
If he holes up there,
no one can pass the strait.

666
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:16,562
And the battle will be over.

667
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:23,921
Maximum speed to the flagship,
before he gets in formation!

668
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:31,760
Sir, that's their main fleet.

669
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:45,371
Raise the flag.

670
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:46,687
Yes, sir.

671
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:36,801
<i>You're mine.</i>

672
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:20,165
Admiral!

673
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:22,641
Captain Ahn!

674
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:26,248
You must be disciplined
under strict martial law,

675
01:30:26,640 --> 01:30:28,802
but as we're at war,

676
01:30:29,160 --> 01:30:31,128
I command you to fight to the death!

677
01:30:31,480 --> 01:30:34,643
Defend Blood Isle with your life!

678
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:36,401
Understood?!

679
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:39,449
Yes, admiral!

680
01:30:40,280 --> 01:30:43,602
We must reach the center
of the strait quickly.

681
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:44,842
Yes, admiral!

682
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:48,963
To the center of the strait!

683
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:17,402
Impeccable timing, sir.

684
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:20,410
The explosion will be massive.

685
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:24,446
<i>We won't fa“ for 'H's decoy.</i>

686
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:28,327
Our main fleet will
continue towards the isle.

687
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:31,482
Sir!

688
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:37,041
A straw-covered ship is approaching!

689
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:40,485
Archers in formation!

690
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:41,527
Yes, sir!

691
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:43,768
Fire!

692
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:54,082
We're sitting ducks!

693
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:55,730
Haul out the water!

694
01:31:56,280 --> 01:31:57,566
Hurry!

695
01:31:58,520 --> 01:32:01,285
We're out of shells on the deck!

696
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:46,885
It severed my chain!

697
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:48,565
Grab his sword!

698
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:05,807
Lim Jun-young?

699
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:08,167
Junsa!

700
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:12,844
It's carrying gunpowder?

701
01:33:21,640 --> 01:33:24,803
Admiral, that vessel is
carrying gunpowder.

702
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:28,209
Our scout Lim is on board.

703
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:34,531
No response from Ahn's ship?!

704
01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:38,246
Load the cannons immediately!

705
01:34:39,560 --> 01:34:42,450
Admiral, there's no answer!

706
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:09,689
Wave something and
make them fire at me!

707
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:20,241
This ship...

708
01:35:22,240 --> 01:35:24,163
mustn't reach the admiral!

709
01:35:28,760 --> 01:35:30,888
YOU must!

710
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:54,010
Good...

711
01:35:55,360 --> 01:35:56,885
That's it...

712
01:36:02,360 --> 01:36:03,691
Let's all signal!

713
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:04,966
Everyone, hurry!

714
01:36:20,920 --> 01:36:21,807
Captain!

715
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:24,601
Over there!

716
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:35,608
A straw ship heading for the flagship!

717
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:41,684
Get ready to fire!

718
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:42,807
Yes, sir!

719
01:37:30,680 --> 01:37:31,806
Ready!

720
01:37:35,080 --> 01:37:37,162
Fire!

721
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:44,129
Good work.

722
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:47,691
So happy to see you,

723
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:51,923
one last time...

724
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:48,088
Admiral!

725
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:50,762
Their vanguard flagship
is heading for us!

726
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:10,882
The enemy's coming!

727
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:12,644
Grab your oars!

728
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:41,841
Finish him off!

729
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:33,010
Close combat!

730
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:34,684
Board their ship!

731
01:40:54,760 --> 01:40:55,522
<i>Kuroda!</i>

732
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:56,169
Hurry!

733
01:40:56,440 --> 01:40:57,851
Should we reinforce?

734
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:13,090
We're shorthanded!

735
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:16,887
Let's reinforce our men on the deck!

736
01:41:23,480 --> 01:41:24,561
Ski-bong!

737
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:25,888
Ski-bong!

738
01:43:15,560 --> 01:43:19,007
Yi Sun-shin! You're mine!

739
01:43:44,920 --> 01:43:48,367
Admiral! Our ships have
come to our aid!

740
01:44:03,480 --> 01:44:04,242
Kimura!

741
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:08,370
Catch up to them!

742
01:44:08,640 --> 01:44:11,769
We've lost control...

743
01:44:16,360 --> 01:44:17,122
Load!

744
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:19,365
Fire!

745
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:33,724
You must request reinforcements!

746
01:44:33,720 --> 01:44:35,245
There is none.

747
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:40,771
We're on our own.

748
01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:49,643
Shouldn't we reinforce them?

749
01:45:12,320 --> 01:45:14,641
Yi Sun-shin.

750
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:53,011
Are you...

751
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:59,085
a SPY or a traitor?!

752
01:46:32,200 --> 01:46:38,207
Yi Sun-shin!

753
01:48:20,120 --> 01:48:21,451
Sir.

754
01:48:22,240 --> 01:48:25,881
I'm afraid our ship is failing...

755
01:49:28,040 --> 01:49:30,088
Admiral!

756
01:49:30,080 --> 01:49:32,606
We'll pull you out!

757
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:56,126
Admiral!

758
01:49:57,240 --> 01:49:59,402
Our fleet is coming!

759
01:50:13,480 --> 01:50:16,529
We must destroy them
before they get into formation!

760
01:50:17,080 --> 01:50:19,208
Why aren't we going faster?!

761
01:50:19,200 --> 01:50:21,407
But the tide has turned...

762
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:23,001
I know that!

763
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,844
Whip the rowers to row faster!

764
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:27,365
Speed! I need speed!

765
01:50:27,360 --> 01:50:29,886
That's our only chance!

766
01:50:30,480 --> 01:50:31,641
Full speed!

767
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:47,808
Don't let go of the oars!

768
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:50,210
Hang in there!

769
01:50:52,440 --> 01:50:54,886
When will this end, damn it?!

770
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:14,646
We're free!

771
01:51:47,320 --> 01:51:48,287
Admiral!

772
01:52:23,160 --> 01:52:24,241
Here is my order!

773
01:52:30,280 --> 01:52:32,203
General

774
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:40,081
It can't be...

775
01:53:05,240 --> 01:53:06,651
Brace for impact!

776
01:53:07,160 --> 01:53:10,607
They're coming in hard!

777
01:53:44,440 --> 01:53:47,842
No!

778
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:13,724
Please, hold on a bit longer.

779
01:54:26,120 --> 01:54:27,963
They broke the front line.

780
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:30,525
Risen from the dead!

781
01:54:31,160 --> 01:54:34,767
Rebirth of the turtle ship!

782
01:54:35,560 --> 01:54:40,441
It has returned!

783
01:55:06,360 --> 01:55:08,442
Was that...

784
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:11,849
a part of his plan all along?

785
01:55:28,040 --> 01:55:30,725
They're fleeing! Look at them!

786
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:39,728
Fire!

787
01:55:52,360 --> 01:55:55,330
Do not look back when the only course is forward

788
01:55:59,760 --> 01:56:01,888
Yi Sun-shin...

789
01:56:06,200 --> 01:56:07,770
Retreat!

790
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:28,684
Turn the ship around.

791
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,890
The tide has again turned in our favor.

792
01:56:41,560 --> 01:56:44,450
Battle report!

793
01:56:44,800 --> 01:56:48,009
31 ships destroyed!

794
01:56:48,600 --> 01:56:52,286
No ally ships lost!

795
01:56:52,720 --> 01:56:58,602
Invade all they want, they can't
do nothing on our watch!

796
01:56:58,600 --> 01:57:03,527
- Have some.
- I'm already full!

797
01:57:04,520 --> 01:57:09,162
I looked one in the eye
and he pissed his pants!

798
01:57:09,160 --> 01:57:11,003
I'm the best!

799
01:57:13,800 --> 01:57:17,441
Will history remember
how hard we fought?

800
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:21,206
Every damn minute.

801
01:57:21,560 --> 01:57:23,767
You speak the truth!

802
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:28,527
We're still breathing,
it's time to go back home.

803
01:57:28,520 --> 01:57:29,646
You said it!

804
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,685
Here, have a drink!

805
01:57:39,080 --> 01:57:40,605
Isn't this taro?

806
01:57:49,480 --> 01:57:51,767
It feels good to eat.

807
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:12,321
Admiral!

808
01:58:12,800 --> 01:58:15,690
Admiral!

809
01:58:54,280 --> 01:58:56,647
HOW can we ease...

810
01:58:59,680 --> 01:59:01,682
their suffering...

811
01:59:16,680 --> 01:59:18,045
Father.

812
01:59:21,040 --> 01:59:25,523
How did you think of
using the whirlpool?

813
01:59:27,320 --> 01:59:28,560
Father?

814
01:59:32,480 --> 01:59:34,687
What did you ask me?

815
01:59:36,080 --> 01:59:40,768
The whirlpool appeared at our
most desperate moment.

816
01:59:40,760 --> 01:59:42,888
If it weren't for that...

817
01:59:49,240 --> 01:59:51,004
It was the grace of God.

818
01:59:52,160 --> 01:59:53,844
The grace of God?

819
01:59:53,840 --> 01:59:58,289
You mean we could've
been defeated?

820
01:59:59,360 --> 02:00:03,160
Yes, indeed.

821
02:00:04,440 --> 02:00:09,480
If the peasants didn't save me then...

822
02:00:12,200 --> 02:00:15,124
Peasants were the grace of God?

823
02:00:15,960 --> 02:00:17,962
Not the whirlpool?

824
02:00:26,920 --> 02:00:32,290
Which do you think it is?

825
02:01:46,520 --> 02:01:47,931
There...

826
02:01:49,680 --> 02:01:50,886
What is that?
